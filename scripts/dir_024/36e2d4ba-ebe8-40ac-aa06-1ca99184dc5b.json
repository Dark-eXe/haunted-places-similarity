If you try enter the hospital with religious material such as: Bibles, holy water flasks, or crosses, they are destroyed before entering the building. On the grounds of the hospital, you can see various ghosts. You can also hear the voices and screams bellow from the hallways of the psych wards. Sightings of little baby's and old people walking inside on different floors and ghostly figures that chase the people that dare to even go inside. Sightings of disfigured creatures roam the basements and tunnels. On various occasions you will see lights on in the rooms of the patients, but no electricity is connected to them and the power has been inactive for years. It isn't even unusual to find possessions on the grounds. -  A WARNING TO ALL THAT INVESTIGATE THE AREA. TRESSPASSERS ARE NOT ALLOWED.
