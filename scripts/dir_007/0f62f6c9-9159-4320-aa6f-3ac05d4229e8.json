The road is curvy and paved, but after a few miles it turns into gravel. Once the road turns to gravel go forward for about another mile till you come to a railroad crossing. Most people do this at midnight, but people have reported seeing spirits as early as 10 pm. The story goes that in the early 1900's a train de-railed killing most of it's passengers. But many odd things turned up once they began to investigate the wreck. A few things were that a woman had been pregnant when she was killed in the wreck and once they found her, the baby was missing out of her womb. Another man had become decapitated during the wreck and the police could never find his head. So once you get to the railroad track you pull onto the tracks and shut off your car. Your windows start to fog up very quickly and you can hear a train whistle in the background, it gets louder...then stops. You will often also see a light when you look down the train tracks. While sitting in the car you will hear something tap on your window and if your brave enough to look outside a woman will be standing there asking you where her baby is. And for the extremely brave, if you decide to get out of you car you will see a decapitated man in the ditch searching for his head, many people have saw this (including myself).", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
