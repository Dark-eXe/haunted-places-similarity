Supposedly her and her friends would drink and do drugs in the woods and one night she had too much to drink and overdosed on heroine. When the teenagers drank in the woods they would bring a lantern with them so they could see and camp out. Well, it turns out the girl died, and if you go into the Indian Rock woods at night sometimes you can sight a girl walking slowly through the woods holding a lantern. Some sightings of this have been reported.", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
