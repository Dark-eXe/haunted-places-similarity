She would open and close the cabinets and turn on the television sets, and talk to little kids. -  May 2005 update / additional information: the first several one bedroom apartments are also haunted. Everything from Red Orbs to black shadow people have been seen in the first few apartments as you enter the building complex. There is rumored that the property was once a burial ground and the county took it over to use as a dumpsite. Much uproar from residents arose when plans to move the bodies were brought to light.", "city_longitude ": "-82.69343429999999", "city ": "Hudson", "id": "61c14c27-8bef-443c-a4be-cc9569b19069", "state_abbrev ": "FL", "city_latitude": "28.3644485", "jaccard_score": 0.00014152723613033085}
