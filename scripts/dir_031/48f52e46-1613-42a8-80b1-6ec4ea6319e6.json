Supposedly, the ghost is of a janitor, which was killed when the balcony collapsed on him while the place was being built. Students here have reported cold spots, lights turning on and off and strange noises occurring. One student even spotted a strange figure in the back of the balcony watching them. A witness reports seeing a giant dog, which chased him and a fellow technician into a storage room, where the dog disappeared, as well as foot steps on the catwalks during a show, and have heard someone screaming from within the auditorium and neighboring hallways, when no one was in the auditorium & cold spots.
