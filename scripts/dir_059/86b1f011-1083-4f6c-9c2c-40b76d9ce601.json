The location is just east of Moore Road just north of Beltline. There is a grave that was supposed to be haunted. It is marked with odd symbols. Apparently, the gravesite does not like its picture being taken because the submitter went through a roll of Polaroid instant film with every picture of the headstone overexposed. Only one picture was normal...a picture of the landscape away from the gravestone.", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
