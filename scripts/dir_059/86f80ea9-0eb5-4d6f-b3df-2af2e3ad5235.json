He haunts the second floor and seems to stay near the front stairway. He is often heard screaming at the current owner\u2019s dog to \"shut up\" and is generally unpleasant most of the time. The owner\u2019s reside on the third floor and when they first moved in, were unaware of these presences and called the police on several occasions to someone wondering around in their building.", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-77.5601563", "city_longitude ": "-77.571382", "location ": "Green Gables", "id": "86f80ea9-0eb5-4d6f-b3df-2af2e3ad5235", "city_latitude": "40.5992395", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
