Her ghost is said to walk the halls, knocking on doors, and calling for her baby- asking where it is. Shadows are seen under the doors when no one is walking by. During a s\u00e9ance 2 different room numbers where given and one of them was a room that was not used, the other room of a suite used by a community advisor (like an RA). This room\u2019s door looked very different from the rest of the doors, had a sort of- darkness above it. And was very obviously off-limits to residents. Rumor is that the numbers of the rooms in that building had been reassigned so that no one would hear about the room the suicide victim lived in and not want to live in it. This could be just a rumor, though. - October Update: This is the legend of Sarah. An eye witness to both the s\u00e9ances reports the findings were fake \u2013 that nothing happened.", "city ": "Warrensburg", "id": "85d920c8-f439-4e60-a074-8f6aee5d09a4", "state_abbrev ": "MO", "location ": "University of Central Missouri", "city_latitude": "38.7627893", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
