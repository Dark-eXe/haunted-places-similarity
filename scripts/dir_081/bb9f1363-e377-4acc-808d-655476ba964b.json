In the boys bathroom, there can be heard men talking about legal issues when no one is around and occasionally, a lawyer in a older style brown suit and rugged briefcase can be seen on Christmas day. Windows with latches come undone by themselves, and the windows will open and close and re-latch on its own. Within the Auditorium itself, ghosts can be seen on the upper balcony watching an invisible show. The most noted person was a man in a black suit with a white shirt on; he has dark brown hair and brown eyes, with a black mustache. He is often seen applauding for an invisible show, and once done applauding he vanishes.", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "36.3274502", "longitude ": "-119.6467996", "city ": "Hanford", "location ": "Hanford Civic Auditorium", "city_longitude ": "-119.6456844", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
