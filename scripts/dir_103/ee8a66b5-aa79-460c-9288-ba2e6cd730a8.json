{"city ": "York", "description ": "Kunkle Mansion - There is a deserted house on the outskirts of Lewisberry/Goldsboro. It cannot be seen from the road, but is off Pine Road near the old bridge. It is quite a hike through the woods to get to it. It actually isn't a mansion, but an old farmhouse. It is supposed to be the site of a large massacre and suicide, where the mother of a very large family couldn't stand being isolated with the children, while her husband was a busy farmer. She snapped and killed all her children with an ax and knife, then killed her husband, and went to the attic and hung herself. After going unnoticed by the locals, they were found. It is now vacant, where parties are held, and satanic rituals were reported. The hike through the woods is eerie, and a presence can be felt. The house is still standing, and the woman can be seen sometimes in the windows, and her sobbing can be heard. A presence was felt in the basement, and a live tree, not dead or decaying fell while someone stood nearby.", "location ": "Lewisberry/Goldsboro", "latitude ": "40.152976", "city_latitude": "39.9625984", "state_abbrev ": "PA", "id": "ee8a66b5-aa79-460c-9288-ba2e6cd730a8", "longitude ": "-76.81855800000001", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-76.727745", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
