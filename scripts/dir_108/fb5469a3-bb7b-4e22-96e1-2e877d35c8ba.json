There is also a spirit who has caused major problems in the store by making accidents happen and causing damage to the merchandise and equipment at the store. The associates have nicknamed the practical joker \"Matilde\" or Matilda\" because the sex is not known. On the other hand, the problem causing spirit has never been named because the associates prefer no contact with that spirit. The Wal-Mart is built on an old homestead site of the original Collins Family who founded Alice. The Old Collins Cemetery is adjacent to the Wal-Mart.-  July 2005 Update: The Wal-Mart has been bought and is now a Sutherlands.", "latitude ": "27.7528764", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
