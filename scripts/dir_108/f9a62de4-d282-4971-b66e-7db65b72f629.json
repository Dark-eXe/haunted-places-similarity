One man died when he fell off some scaffold and dropped 100 feet on his head during the building of the auditorium. The second man was an actor in a play by the school's drama club. A scene where the main character was shot was tragically ended when another member of the club put a live bullet in the prop gun for the play. Custodians in the building report lights being turned back on after several attempts to turn them off. And a seat on the left side has cold areas noticed by anyone who sits there. During plays where a scene is very sad, the left curtain blows when there is no draft.", "latitude ": "35.6359364", "city_latitude": "35.6224561", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
