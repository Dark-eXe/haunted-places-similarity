{"longitude ": "-117.0851668", "state_abbrev ": "OR", "description ": "Malheur Butte is a dead volcano overlooking Ontario, Oregon (the extreme edge of eastern Oregon). According to legend, it once was a popular meeting place of witches. The Snake River is also in the vicinity and supposedly draws wicca ceremonies due to the fact that it flows south-to-north. Near the Butte (and in the outlying areas, as well) many people have spotted small, shadow-like creatures after dark. A witness claims she was chased to her car by something she couldn't see very well. Whatever it was made noises and was about the size of a dog. Even though she doesn't spook easily, she was terrified by the incident. A few years prior, another witness claimed to have seen a similar creature at a nearby park one night. Other sightings have occurred. In addition to these alleged 'imps' the entire area surrounding Malheur Butte emanates a creepy vibe that is unmistakable.", "city_latitude": "44.0265525", "location ": "Malheur Butte", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-116.9629378", "state ": "Oregon", "latitude ": "44.0109959", "id": "fb367b62-7400-4719-99fe-e454350104a4", "city ": "Ontario", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
