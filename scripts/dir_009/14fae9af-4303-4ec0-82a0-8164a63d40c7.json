This tree was reportedly used for numerous lynchings and is currently surrounded by a small community that has been in this area since pre-antebellum. Reported that bodies can be seen in the tree from a distance and if it is approached, the swaying bodies will stare at the trespassers. Other sightings conclude that there is a murder of crows that constantly watch for trespassers as well.", "id": "14fae9af-4303-4ec0-82a0-8164a63d40c7", "latitude ": "38.2642199", "city ": "Leefield", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
