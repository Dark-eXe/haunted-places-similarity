{"description ": "It is said that in the early part of when Athens was being built a circus came into town by train to entertain the citizens of Athens. When the train was just about to arrive to the town it wrecked underneath a bridge in Athens. All the animals died, but the interesting thing was that body of the monkeys were never found.
