Cars have been also been known to stall, and then start again on their own. Pounding can even be heard on the outside of the vehicle. On the right side of the path, when the moon is just right, one can see a tombstone. The stone will sometimes have a blue tinge to it with a floating figure standing behind it. No one knows the story of the tombstone in the middle of the woods, but no one dares to get close enough to investigate.", "city ": "Baltimore", "state_abbrev ": "MD", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
