This place is rumored to be the site of a Civil War battle and the bridge closest to Eldridge is haunted. If you park in the center of the bridge and turn your car off there will begin to be tapping noises all over your car. They aren't just the sounds of your car settling. They are mostly on the sides and the back of the car. It is said to be the spirits of the soldiers who died. Be careful, this road is absolutely pitch black at night, however you can see cars coming from either direction at quite a distance.", "city ": "Houston", "city_latitude": "29.7604267", "latitude ": "29.813318", "longitude ": "-95.631177", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
