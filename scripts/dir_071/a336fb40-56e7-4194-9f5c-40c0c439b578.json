{"description ": "The Cemetery is very old and has grave stones going back to the late 1800s/early 1900's and is very haunted But one of many is there is a family grave site where many people have said to have witnessed a young girl sitting over a grave crying(believed to be her mother) . Many people have tried to give their assistance to the girl but she only looks at them and disappears . Another site is of a 19 year old girls grave from the late 1800s , she is said to have been a preachers daughter but betrayed him in not believing the religion he taught, so her family disowned her and she killed herself . The bible on top of her grave is said to be broken in half sometimes and sometimes appears perfectly normal.", "state_abbrev ": "OH", "city ": "Miamisburg", "city_latitude": "39.6428362", "location ": "Hill Grove Cemetery", "longitude ": "-84.274625", "latitude ": "39.6392318", "city_longitude ": "-84.2866083", "country ": "United States", "state ": "Ohio", "id": "a336fb40-56e7-4194-9f5c-40c0c439b578", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
