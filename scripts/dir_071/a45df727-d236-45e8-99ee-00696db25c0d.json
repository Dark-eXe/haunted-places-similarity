Mind you, this was a punishable by death in those days. After committing his crime he decided to go to the Walker House for a drink. The Walker House is a large restaurant/bar/hotel. While he was in the bar, a mob came, dragged him out of the bar and promptly hung him on a tree outside. Since then he has haunted the Walker House. Visitors and employees have seen floating heads, felt cold drafts, been locked in the walk-in freezers and several other mischievous things.", "city_longitude ": "-90.1798473", "latitude ": "42.8573707", "longitude ": "-90.1759478", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
