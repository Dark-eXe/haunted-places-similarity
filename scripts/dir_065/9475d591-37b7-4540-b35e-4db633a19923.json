People have seen an old lady in the basement area. They have a pool table in the basement. Some people were playing pool once, when one of them sank a shot and went to get the ball. He reached for the ball and the ball wasn't in the pocket. He looked up to the others and asked where is the ball. When he said that the ball fell from the ceiling onto the table. There are norrow winding stairs that lead to a room. In the secluded upstairs room, there are words written on the wall with red crayon in a little child's handwriting.
