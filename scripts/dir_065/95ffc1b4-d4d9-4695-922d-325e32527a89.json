{"city ": "Moreno Valley", "state ": "California", "description ": "Years ago, a bus occupied with children supposedly broke down and was hit by a large diesel truck, pushing them over the freeway overpass. There were no survivors. It is now said that when a car visits this site, when shut off and put in neutral, the spirits of the deceased children will push the car UP over the overpass. This only works when going South. In addition, baby powder sprinkled/poured on the back of the vehicle will allow handprints and footprints of the children to be visible. Sometimes laughter and footsteps can be heard late at night.", "state_abbrev ": "CA", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-117.1915375", "latitude ": "33.9229759", "location ": "Nason Street", "id": "95ffc1b4-d4d9-4695-922d-325e32527a89", "city_latitude": "33.9424658", "city_longitude ": "-117.2296717", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
