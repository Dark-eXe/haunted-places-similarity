This was near a grave that read \"murdered by human wolves\" Lights were pointed everywhere nothing was seen. - November 2003 update: the murdered by human wolves grave is not in sacred heart cemetery. its in a little cemetery just off the highway outside of Konawa but before you get to sacred heart. The submitter does not know if you can actually hear dogs growling but its said the girl died after having a botched abortion and that's why the tombstone says murdered by human wolves.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
