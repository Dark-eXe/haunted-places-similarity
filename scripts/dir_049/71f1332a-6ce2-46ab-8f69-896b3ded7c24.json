Students have seen the ghost on several occasions. The fourth floor also exhibits inexplicable cold spots and mild poltergeist activity. Students constantly hear footsteps moving around above them in a vacant attic. A student who lives near the attic stairwell said she felt someone grabbing her arm and her room seems to always be cold. According to legend there are 5 spirits in the building. One of which (the most active) was a female college student who lived in the 1800's. She committed suicide after her boyfriend left her when he found out she was pregnant.", "longitude ": "-70.448804", "state ": "Maine", "city_longitude ": "-70.44422519999999", "state_abbrev ": "ME", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
