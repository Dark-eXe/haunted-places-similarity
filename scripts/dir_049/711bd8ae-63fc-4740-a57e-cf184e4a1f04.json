If you go and park your car or just park a little off the bridge and you get out there is a tall dark thing about 7-8 ft tall. It will either try to throw things at you or chase after you. WARNING: Do NOT go out here, stay off this bridge, this thing is not good and you will be terrified. I strongly suggest the un-stable mind stay out of here too, unless you are up for psychological damage.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
