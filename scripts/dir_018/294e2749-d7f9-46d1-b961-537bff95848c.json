The room caught on fire trapping her in her room and killing her. Workers at the college cleaned and repainted the room. A new student moved in and 2 weeks the walls turned chard as if nobody ever painted them. Every year the walls are repainted and they continuously turn chard again. The room is no longer used.", "city_longitude ": "-79.9958864", "id": "294e2749-d7f9-46d1-b961-537bff95848c", "city_latitude": "40.44062479999999", "state_abbrev ": "PA", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-80.0012691", "city ": "Pittsburgh", "location ": "Point Park College", "latitude ": "40.43850279999999", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
