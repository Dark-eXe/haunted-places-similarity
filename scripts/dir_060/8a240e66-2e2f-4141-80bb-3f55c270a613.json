There are tracks that cross the street where 271 turns into 272. Stories of the train still goes over the tracks. Also if you park your car on the tracks and turn off your engine you will hear a train and see people walking toward you car. Will also be hard to start the car. Also have seen a ghost train on the tracks around 3AM on some nights.
