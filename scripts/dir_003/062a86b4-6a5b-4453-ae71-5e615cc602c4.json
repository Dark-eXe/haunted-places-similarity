Cleaning staff over the years have claimed to experience things when they are alone in the building. One spoke of a periodic flurry of ghostly activity in the hallways on one of the upper floors when spirits change classes -- doors sounding as if they're opening and closing, faint laughter and voices in the hallways... Another staff member swore she was touched on the shoulder while cleaning a classroom, only to turn around and find no one. She also said she was cleaning one of the ballet rooms and, slipping from her stepladder and falling backwards, was caught by an unknown force and set down gently, unharmed. In the basement, where an empty pool sits, workers are sure they've heard splashing.", "city ": "Brockport", "latitude ": "43.210018", "city_longitude ": "-77.9391797", "city_latitude": "43.2136713", "longitude ": "-77.9507327", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
