Also, a very horrible feeling of foreboding often comes with hearing these cries and screams. One couple, just using the cemetery as a short cut, heard & felt it, \u201dThe sound and feelings were very alarming in the fact that they seemed to be all around us, as if inside the vehicle with us. It was a very frightening experience due to the fact that it was indeed broad daylight when this occurred.\u201d", "city_latitude": "37.63909719999999", "id": "a68b0c1a-e4b8-4b76-8aa8-e62a8fa1bd4b", "state_abbrev ": "CA", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-120.9968782", "longitude ": "-120.98384", "city ": "Modesto", "latitude ": "37.6480539", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
