In the 1960's a mother of one of the black panthers hid her black panther son there for 3 years. In those tunnels there is an abandoned shooting range and you hear those guns going off during school hours. And early in the morning around 6:30 when the hall lights are off you see student apparitions in the distance of the oldest building there.", "location ": "Lincoln Heights", "longitude ": "-118.2115093", "state_abbrev ": "CA", "city_longitude ": "-118.2436849", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "34.0739389", "city ": "Los Angeles", "city_latitude": "34.0522342", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
