The head cheerleader broke up with one of the football players. The guy hung himself in one of the upstairs room. The sisters got into a big fight because of it.(in the same room.) One pushed the other one down the stairs (Head-cheerleader down the stairs.) Half killing her. So she picked her up brought her back up to the top of the stairs, dragging her by her feet so her head would drag killing her. If you go there on Halloween night you can hear the screams of the one sister and her head dragging across the floor. The other one always said she never wanted to kill her just make her mad.
