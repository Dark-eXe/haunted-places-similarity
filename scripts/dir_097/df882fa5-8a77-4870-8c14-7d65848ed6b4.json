It was moved more than seventy years ago to the center of Batavia because of a flooding problem. When the creek flooded, it would sometimes wash up a body or two. It is believed that not all of the bodies were relocated. There now stands a number of businesses where the original cemetery once was. People claim to this day of seeing a mysterious woman in gray walking along the creekside.", "city_latitude": "42.9981156", "latitude ": "", "location ": "Tonawanda Creekside North", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
