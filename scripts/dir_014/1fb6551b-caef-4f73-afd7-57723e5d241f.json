Magnun/Bullocks building", "country ": "United States", "description ": "On Wilshire Boulevard near Vermont. Now part of the Southwest Law School, the old department store built in 1929 was converted into a law library. A security guard working there during its renovation could hear a little girl's voice crying from the elevator shaft. It was rumored that a man had pushed the girl into the elevator shaft, killing her back in the 1930's. Other strange happenings observed were lights coming on and off, windows and shades being open and closed with no one in the building, and footsteps being heard on the stairway. Some construction workers reported finding secret passageways that lead from Mr. Bullock's penthouse in the building. Several construction workers had quit during remodeling due to unexplained phenomena taking place in the building's clock tower.", "city ": "Los Angeles", "city_latitude": "34.0522342", "longitude ": "-118.2884225", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
