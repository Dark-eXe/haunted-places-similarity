An odd but true tale, and a strange presence can fairly easily be felt in Dead President's, even by non-psychic individuals.", "state_abbrev ": "DE", "latitude ": "39.7511665", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-75.5397878", "state ": "Delaware", "city_latitude": "39.7390721", "city ": "Wilmington", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
