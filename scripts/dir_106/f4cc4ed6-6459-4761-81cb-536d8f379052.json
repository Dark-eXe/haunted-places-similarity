Dark figures have been seen walking around and standing over graves and a few people have been attacked or approached by figures that refused to step into light. An Indian has also been seen out there, it is a place that you feel someone is watching you at all times. Being by the mausoleum is probably the best place to see or hear things or along the river bank.", "id": "f4cc4ed6-6459-4761-81cb-536d8f379052", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
