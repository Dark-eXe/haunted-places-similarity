She was shot by a soldier while trying to save her baby, who was in the wagon with her. People have reported hearing Sarah Jane and also the babe cry while standing on the bridge at night. Here is another explanation of the Sara Jane Haunting... A woman left her abusive husband, so to get back at her, the man took their 5-year-old girl, and jumped of the side of a bridge. The woman searched for the girl for years, and finally got so distraught that she hung herself off the side of the same bridge that her daughter and husband jumped off of. It is said that at midnight, if you drive across the bridge, you can see the noose on the side on the railing and you hear a woman's voice saying, \"Sara Jane, Sara Jane, where are you my Sara Jane\".", "longitude ": "-93.9604157", "location ": "Sarah Jane Road", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
