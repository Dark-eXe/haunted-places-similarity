{"description ": "Beaver Creek State Park - Esther Hale has allegedly been haunting the bridge over Beaver Creek for nearly 165 years, since she was stood up at her own wedding in 1837. Four months after her wedding date, Esther was found dead in her home, her bridle veil still over her face. Some say she is still dressed in white looking for her groom, and if you travel over the Beaver Creek bridge on August 12th each year, you'll see her. Don't let her get too close-her touch will kill you.", "latitude ": "40.6763746", "state_abbrev ": "OH", "city_longitude ": "-80.5764592", "id": "cf495d9e-6691-4358-b2b7-2ce4ad82a477", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "40.673397", "state ": "Ohio", "location ": "East Liverpool", "longitude ": "-80.6063211", "city ": "Calcutta", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
