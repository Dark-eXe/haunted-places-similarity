{"description ": "There is a cemetery on the left hand side of the road when going up Grahm Hill road right off of Highway 17 in S.C. This cemetery is pretty strange there is a lot of action going on in here. You can see faces and things moving inside of the cemetery. If you pull into the driveway towards the end of the cemetery and shine your headlights you will see a white figure coming towards you. MOVE! This ghost is not friendly. There are many orbs that you can see with the naked eye and some strange noises heard from the East end of the Cemetery. Faces are seen in the headstones and Dark shadows above them.", "state ": "California", "city_longitude ": "-122.0307963", "location ": "Grahm Hill Road Cemetery", "city ": "Santa Cruz", "state_abbrev ": "CA", "latitude ": "36.9883794", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "36.9741171", "longitude ": "-122.0277401", "id": "7501bd15-272b-4f84-b279-7970c875a1e4", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
