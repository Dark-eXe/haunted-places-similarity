{"state ": "Texas", "description ": "Abigail reportedly died while storing boxes under the stage. Now she is sometimes seen on the catwalk, and plays with the gels on the spots. Students hit the stage with a hammer 3 times to keep her from interfering with a show, and sometimes, when reviewing a tape of a show, they can spot her standing in the set's shadows. - January 2007 Update / Correction: You can check yearbooks, newspapers, death records, and media and find that there was no Abigail or tragedies under the stage. However, even though the story is fabricated, many say strange things happen to them while in the theatre. Noises can be heard. Some say a female voice can mimick your female voice from around the theatre and give tech commands when you didn't give them. Is this because they know the \"story\" of Abigail or has the belief in Abigail and her story made her a reality in the theatre? Or could it be someone else?", "city_latitude": "32.9756415", "location ": "Newman Smith High School", "city ": "Carrollton", "city_longitude ": "-96.8899636", "id": "d6821b78-f29a-4423-9ffb-f9e871062bd2", "latitude ": "32.9790746", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-96.8922292", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
