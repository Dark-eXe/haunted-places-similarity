I have been to this place many times, and taken pictures, and many times even though it was a clear night, the pictures have come back covered in white blotches. You will find many out of the ordinary happenings on the way out to the tree. - September 2004 update /correction: It has recently been cut down and moved to the church parking lot at the top of the road. The three humps were also left off the stroy. There are three evenly spaced humps righ before the bend the tree was on. These are the graves of the witchs. the stories of destorted pictures are true though.", "state_abbrev ": "KY", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
