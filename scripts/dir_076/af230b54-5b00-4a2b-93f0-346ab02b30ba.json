In the 1st floor men\u2019s room\u00a0it is always 15 to 20 degrees cooler the rest of the building and you feel as if you are being watched. In the basement there is the old morgue and you can see bloody footprints\u00a0on the floor, walls and ceiling. On the 3rd floor you will here a toilet flush with no one in the bathroom and the elevator runs up and down on it's own. You can also see the ghost of Charlie Auchenba. There are a number of cold spots and areas where you feel as though you are being watched. You can also see the\u00a0shadow of a person standing on the ledge in several of the rooms on 3rd floor. I would warn people about going there now cause it was sold and the guy that owns it WILL call the cops on you if you are caught trespassing. However, if you can get permission to check it out it is well worth it.", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "37.0139169", "city ": "Hartner", "latitude ": "37.0189418", "location ": "Auchenba", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
