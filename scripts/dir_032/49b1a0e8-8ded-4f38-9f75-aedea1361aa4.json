The wife of the slave had a local shaman put a curse on the slave owner. The curse was that he would bear the reminder of his murder for eternity. After he was buried, a chain appeared on his tombstone, and every year another link is added. It is located at a church called Bonds Chapel which still holds services. It is actually about five miles south (as the crow flies) from Huron.", "city ": "Oragneville", "latitude ": "", "city_latitude": "38.6235601", "city_longitude ": "-86.5602614", "state ": "Indiana", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
