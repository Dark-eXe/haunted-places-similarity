She hates electricity. The second ghost is a ghost cat. The cat has been seen at least twice in a particular spot upstairs. A young girl once saw a man go up to the gate and asked about him. She identified the man in a picture of the original owner. Noises can be heard all through the night, but the ghosts are nice.", "id": "7366acf6-98dd-4e78-a578-c20f8a53cdfd", "latitude ": "43.23884899999999", "city ": "Grantville", "state_abbrev ": "GA", "country ": "United States", "state ": "Georgia", "city_longitude ": "-84.8357678", "city_latitude": "33.2348419", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
