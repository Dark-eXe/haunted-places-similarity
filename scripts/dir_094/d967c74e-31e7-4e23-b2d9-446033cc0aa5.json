It's unlike any other cemetery; It has no real paths leading up to it. It is an area about one half of an acre where several members of the Schroyer family were buried in the late 1800's. Today only one grave remains, the grave of Mr. Schroyer himself. There have been multiple reports of Blue orbs floating around and even reports of Demonic voices and an old man walking through the cemetery. There has also been a child sited with hair all over him. This is believed to be the child, which was born with horrible deformities and dissapeared. - Like any other place on the Haunted Paces List, this is a reminder to to always get permission before you investigate and HAVE RESPECT for the places listed.", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "39.6819447", "longitude ": "-96.6674872", "latitude ": "39.7049369", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
