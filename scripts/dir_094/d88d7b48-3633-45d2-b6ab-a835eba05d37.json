Before it was placed in the chapel, it was near the stairs. A person going through the house would sometimes see a man dressed as a monk near the stairs. He hasn't been seen since he was moved to the chapel. Also, reportedly all the ghosts come from these antiques. The castle was built by Oliver Belmont in the late 1800's during the gilded age of Newport.", "state_abbrev ": "RI", "id": "d88d7b48-3633-45d2-b6ab-a835eba05d37", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
