Old room 311 is supposedly haunted by sounds and a door that locks itself, but renovations of the school have renumbered the rooms and straightened out the hallway. Many places in the basement have been said to be haunted as well as the fourth floor attic. Again, renovations have made these places harder to find. There are also tunnels under the school that are said to have a presence occupying them.", "country ": "United States", "state_abbrev ": "MO", "city ": "Springfield", "id": "25ea5391-bee9-4804-a3fd-cb025d283917", "location ": "Central High School", "city_longitude ": "-93.2922989", "latitude ": "37.217994", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
