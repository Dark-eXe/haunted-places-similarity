One night a manager and a cashier were getting ready to lock up when the bell at the service desk started ringing. Also strange voices have been heard on the intercom system after hours. The store built in the 1980's may have been built on an abandoned cemetery.", "city ": "Perry County", "id": "9c213dc3-bc63-47d1-8421-22a6aca7e8a7", "state ": "Kentucky", "location ": "Hazard", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-83.1932284", "latitude ": "37.24954", "state_abbrev ": "KY", "city_longitude ": "-83.2077645", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
