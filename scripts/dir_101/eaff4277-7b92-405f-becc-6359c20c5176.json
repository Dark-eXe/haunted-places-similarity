Since it is far back in the orange groves, many teenagers used to use it as a place to party around the asylum but never inside. There have been many stories of hauntings there. One high school boy once went in to explore the asylum by himself & never came back out. A ghost of a middle-aged woman has been seen on numerous occasions. She is extremely violent & known to do harm to people that cross her path inside the insane asylum.", "longitude ": "-117.207113", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
