He got out to change it, and when he got back in the car, she was gone. He looked around for her, and saw her hanging in a tree. Someone had hung her and he was never found. If you go out there at night, turn off the lights on your truck/car, you'll hear someone knock for a ride home. Also, it's been reported that you can see her dangling from a tree, and something will sound like footsteps walking across the top of your car.", "state_abbrev ": "NC", "latitude ": "36.2602527", "city_longitude ": "-76.3774387", "id": "ea9e571d-e230-44de-8725-807eb79a3110", "longitude ": "-76.38195639999999", "location ": "Hertford", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
