To this day no one knows who or what killed them. Some say that it was just a tree branch falling on the roof. When their mother found them, their faces were ashen, eyes blood red, faces twisted with terror. Every year on the day they were found dead, screams can be heard, echoing down the halls. There are also sounds of struggling, but then there is quiet. Then all of a sudden, you see a flash of light in the halls, and then the power goes out. That happens about every two years for a few weeks on and off. I pity you if you live in that building.
