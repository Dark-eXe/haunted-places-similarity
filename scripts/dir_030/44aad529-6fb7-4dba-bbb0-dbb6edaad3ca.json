One brother fell off and the wheel decapitated him. The light is the lantern of the other brother looking for the head. The brother is with his lantern passing one row at a time in the corn. If you go when the corn is down, you will see a light come towards you. if the corn is up (the best time to go) you see the orange/red glow from the lantern at the end of a row. it will move through the row of corn and you can see the light above the corn. It's slowly moves to the end of the row and back to the start of the row. Then it will move up one more rows. You can watch the light come closer and closer one row at a time", "city_longitude ": "-86.8794613", "location ": "\"The Light\"", "id": "44aad529-6fb7-4dba-bbb0-dbb6edaad3ca", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "", "state ": "Indiana", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
