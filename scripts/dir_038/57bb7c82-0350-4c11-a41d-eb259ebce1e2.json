It is wrecked but no one has bothered to destroy it. There are at least two spirits inhabiting the house. One is inside the house and the other is outside. Inside the house, there are boxes, ladders, and cans of paint as if someone was going to remodel the house but stopped and left. There are many odd spots such as in the attic, there is a hole in the ceiling and if you look up into it, you feel as though something is looking back. Sounds such as doors creaking open (even when all are nailed shut) and someone slamming glass against a wall have been heard.
