{"description ": "It is believed that Carroll High School is cursed and haunted. Every year a junior student dies surprisingly, and eventually the student comes back to haunt and be known. One example,(not mentioning the name), a girl who died, came back to be remembered. A day after her death, in class, a boy took her original seat and fell off. To everyone's surprise, they asked him if he was alright. He then replied, in a shocked look, \"No, not really.\" The teacher asked why. He replied back \"I didn't fall, I was pushed.\"", "state_abbrev ": "IN", "city_latitude": "41.079273", "longitude ": "-85.1925191", "city ": "Fort Wayne", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-85.1393513", "location ": "Carroll High School", "id": "032bfc7a-7ebf-402c-bd5b-da8fbbf0a3b5", "latitude ": "41.1903467", "state ": "Indiana", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
