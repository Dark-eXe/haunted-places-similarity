On several occasions, this pillar is scheduled to be removed for development, but on each occasion the person who was supposed to remove it died unexpectedly. A few years ago a driver lost control of his car and bumped into the pillar. He was dead in his car when the police arrived, but the accident was not life threatening. It is said that a slave put a curse on the pillar to which he was tied as he was being sold. For whatever reason, the pillar still stands alone with nothing else around it on the corner of Broad Street.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
