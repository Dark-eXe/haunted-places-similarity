It is said that a man who was very depressed decided to commit suicide by slitting his wrists and making his way from the bedroom to the bathroom where he was found by the maintenance engineer. To moment you enter the room you are greeted with a presence of this man. Its almost impossible to sleep in this room although its been renovated completely.
