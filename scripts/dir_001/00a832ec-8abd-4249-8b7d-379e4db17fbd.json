Built in the 1800s, it has been said that the school grounds lay over an Indian burial ground; thus making some very unhappy metaphysical presences. Moffat Hall was the first residence hall built on campus. Though there are quite a few known stories of many different people dying (suicide mostly), there is no real known explanation for the ghost that haunts the girls bathroom in suite 2A. Walking into the bathroom late at night you can hear a girl crying, an apparition of the girl has been spotted.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
