Drive all the way up and down over the hills on the dirt road until you come to the third bridge. Local High School students have died there in and car accident. Drums can be heard in the distance and if people visiting the bridge are loud and obnoxious, the drums get louder and closer as though whomever playing them wants you to hear. It is said that an Indian massacre took place there in which settlers killed the men in battle and then returned and killed the woman and children of the tribe. Some have reported fog rolling in from both directions and have seen a man floating on a horse and other strange things.", "latitude ": "40.754207", "city_longitude ": "-104.8319195", "id": "0241b837-90e5-4b97-b55b-e49127bd802f", "country ": "United States", "city ": "Aurora", "state ": "Colorado", "location ": "Third Bridge #2", "longitude ": "-73.987557", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
