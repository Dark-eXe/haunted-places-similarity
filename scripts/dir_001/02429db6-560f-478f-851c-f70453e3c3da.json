We had split up for the purpose of looking for a family members grave, we then turned around to meet up with each other. As we got closer to each other, we suddenly felt nauseated and we felt chilled. We looked at each other and realized we were all experiencing the same sensations. We looked down at the grave in front of us, and it had the name, Benjamin Bennett on it. The next day we went to the library to see if we could find anything out about this person.
