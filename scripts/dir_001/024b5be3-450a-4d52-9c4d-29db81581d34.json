{"latitude ": "40.5972867", "state_abbrev ": "PA", "description ": "Fort Roberdeau - When you get to the road into Fort Roberdeau you go through a corn field which is where the fort once stood. The fort was moved from that location and rebuilt about 1/4 of a mile down the same road which apparently disturbed the ground. The original location of the fort is where the hauntings take place. A dark figure supposedly a guard to the entrance of the fort can be seen walking back and forth near one of the old wooden power line poles. On the left side of the corn field is where two orbs can be seen, light and dark. These orbs are supposed to be children running in the field. Other experienced include eerie feelings, unusual fog activity, and occasionally, odd noises. The road is public, the actual fort is a Historic Site, admission during the day.", "country ": "United States", "id": "024b5be3-450a-4d52-9c4d-29db81581d34", "city ": "Sinking Valley", "city_latitude": "40.5972867", "longitude ": "-78.27316540000001", "location ": "Tyrone Township", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "city_longitude ": "-78.27316540000001", "jaccard_score": 0.00014152723613033085}
