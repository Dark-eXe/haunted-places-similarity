{"description ": "Library-Music Section - In the Reading Room of the Music Section of the Library there is always a moaning noise that sometimes sounds like voices. Also, the room is always extremely cold or extremely hot. In another part of the Music Library, the Harp room, a mysterious chair, called the \"ghost chair\" by some appeared out of nowhere and the librarians can't account for where it came from. There is also a room in the back called the Music Recordings Archives where rows and rows of old records lie practically untouched and students often get scared or spooked in this room.", "state ": "Utah", "location ": "Brigham Young University", "longitude ": "-111.6493156", "city_longitude ": "-111.6585337", "id": "4124d906-f573-410b-84ba-cd73fc691815", "country ": "United States", "city ": "Provo", "city_latitude": "40.2338438", "state_abbrev ": "UT", "latitude ": "40.2518435", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
