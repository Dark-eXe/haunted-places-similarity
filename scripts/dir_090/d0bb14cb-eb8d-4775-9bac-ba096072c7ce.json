It is also said to be haunted by a little boy who had an asthma attack during lunch one day. Lights still turn on and off and there is no electricity. December 2006 Additional Information: There always had stories of the janitor that haunted the halls. There was an old wall-piano that was supposed to be sent to the local High School. One day, it was sitting on a landing. The next day, it was in shambles at the bottom of the stairs. Chandler has since been reopened. It is an apartment building for elderly folks.", "id": "d0bb14cb-eb8d-4775-9bac-ba096072c7ce", "city ": "Johnstown", "city_latitude": "40.32674069999999", "longitude ": "-78.94686060000001", "location ": "Chandler School", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
