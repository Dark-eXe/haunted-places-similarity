Coming to a narrow bridge over the Trinity River they met their fate when they did not see another car coming hitting it head on. Both cars erupted into flames and plummeted into the river below. All involved were killed and since then the road has been closed and can only be walked to through the park. Legend has it that if you find the bridge you will see the dates of the occurrence and the names of the deceased glowing as tombstones in the water and if after that you still dare you can sit in the middle of the bridge on the night that it happened and at midnight you will witness a heavy fog coming up from the river as you see headlights approaching from either side of the bridge.", "latitude ": "32.7903322", "city ": "Arlington", "city_longitude ": "-97.1080656", "location ": "River Legacy Park", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
