He was walking by the area of the school that was being built at around 7:00pm Pacific Time. A man in dark clothes grabbed him and stabbed him 10 times. 4 times in the face, 2 in the arm, and 4 in the chest area. A person in a car drove by and saw a body on the ground. It was Jon. They never caught the man who killed him. [Fact] At school kids and some adults see a dark figure that is blurred out in corners and darker areas. Girls and women reported seeing figures in a bathroom by the cafeteria. The figure roams the halls most of the time between 12:00 in the afternoon till about 5:00pm.", "id": "12d80df8-17ab-45b8-b790-0be883ff80e1", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-117.4260465", "longitude ": "-117.2520123", "state ": "Washington", "state_abbrev ": "WA", "city_latitude": "47.6587802", "latitude ": "47.6376018", "location ": "Bowdish Middle School", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
