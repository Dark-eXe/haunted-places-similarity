{"city ": "Dover", "description ": "The haunting of the local Stone Quarry also known as the lights of the Stone Quarry. Legend has it that when a settler had come to our town over 100 years ago, he had an affair with an Indian maiden. His wife found out about the affair and went after the husband and his mistress. As the wife was chasing them, they came to a cliff. So instead of suffering the wrath of the wife, the man and the Indian maiden jumped to their deaths. After the bodies were found, They were refused a Christian burial. But from that day forward if you look at where the cliff once stood, you can see the death lights of the two lovers. The Stone Quarry now stands where the cliff once stood over 100 years ago.", "id": "042e0c5b-fbe9-46d1-bac8-edbbf62669fe", "city_longitude ": "-81.4740054", "state_abbrev ": "OH", "city_latitude": "40.5206198", "location ": "Stone Quarry", "country ": "United States", "state ": "Ohio", "longitude ": "-81.48194099999999", "latitude ": "40.493663", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
