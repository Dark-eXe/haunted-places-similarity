When you drive down the road late at night, you experience weird unexplained fog, and right after you pass through the fog you can see a teenage girl standing along side the road crying. She appears to be looking for something. Different people have tried to communicate with her to find out what she is looking for, and it appears to be a locket that she lost when she was in the car accident that took her life.
