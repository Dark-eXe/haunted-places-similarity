{"state ": "California", "description ": "Revolution - formerly the 76er - On roller coaster a girl working as an attendant was crushed and dragged by incoming cars when she accidentally stepped onto the track. Some employees mention that they have seen their co-worker by the tracks in the train station or in the tunnel shortly after the loop on the coaster. They mentioned that they saw the apparition and another employee mentioned they heard screams on another occasion. It appears these incidents happen after closing around 1 AM in the morning for some odd reason. The employee had been killed though during business hours.", "location ": "Six Flags", "state_abbrev ": "CA", "city_longitude ": "-118.5713823", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "34.4253305", "city ": "Valencia", "id": "4d9a2bee-2276-41e4-b286-1124a0c14eab", "longitude ": "-118.5972191", "city_latitude": "34.456151", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
