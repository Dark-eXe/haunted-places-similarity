Most of the activity occurs around theatres 8 and 9. Theatre 9 is always eerily cold, even with the heaters on. Upstairs in the projection booth above #9, lights turned off by employees sometimes mysteriously come back on. It is also said you can see a figure's shadow when movies are on against the wall in theatre #6.", "city_longitude ": "-118.1137535", "id": "667fae45-6e97-4284-b298-a4a1855c2ff5", "city_latitude": "34.0165053", "state_abbrev ": "CA", "country ": "United States", "location ": "AMC Montebello 10 Theatres", "city ": "Montebello", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
