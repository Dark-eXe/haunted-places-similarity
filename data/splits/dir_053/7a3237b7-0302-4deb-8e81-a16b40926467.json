A student in his early twenties, late teens, committed suicide from the top floor of the University's dorm hall over a distraught fight with his girlfriend. Feelings of being watched, girls would wake up in the middle of the night and see a man in the room, then they would look twice then nothing was there, weird sounds. Very creepy if you're up there alone.", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "37.7351902", "location ": "Keene Hall 16th Floor", "id": "7a3237b7-0302-4deb-8e81-a16b40926467", "state_abbrev ": "KY", "longitude ": "-84.3045954", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
