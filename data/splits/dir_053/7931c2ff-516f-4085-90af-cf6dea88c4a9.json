{"description ": "Mary O'Leary's grave - Behind Queen of the Rosary Academy, there is a cemetery that priests and nuns were buried in.\u00a0 A young novice had fallen in love with one of the grounds keepers.\u00a0 She snuck out of the convent one night to meet her lover. They were going to run away and get married. Before her lover got there she was raped and murdered.\u00a0 Because of the horrible way that she was murdered she could not be buried in the cemetery so they buried her where they found her body.\u00a0 on the night of a full moon if you pulled up by her grave stone you could see her standing on the road side. They have since opened the road and her gravestone can no longer be found. However, when you drive a certain point of new highway, you can hear screams.", "state ": "New York", "state_abbrev ": "NY", "city_latitude": "40.9848784", "location ": "Lindenhurst", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-73.3734547", "latitude ": "40.68676670000001", "city_longitude ": "-72.61511689999999", "city ": "Suffolk County", "id": "7931c2ff-516f-4085-90af-cf6dea88c4a9", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
