There is only one gardener employed at the O.S.P.C.A. and it is a man. However, the Real gardener states that he never has to do any gardening behind the gates of the crematory because it is always weed free. Many employees have asked who the lady is weeding in the crematory, when their supervisors are approached with this question they simply state. Its is a ghost. We don't know why or how she came to garden at the crematory but are grateful that she does a wonderful upkeep of her area.", "longitude ": "-122.1942045", "city ": "Oakland", "city_latitude": "37.8043637", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
