The cemetery has only a handful of tombstones, many of which have been vandalized or withered with age. There is reference to several mass graves there from a plague of small pox and a major fire that destroyed the town. The cemetery has produced several tales of problems with electrical devices such as cars and radios, as well as sightings of ghostly figures and childish laughter.", "longitude ": "-84.6351845", "country ": "United States", "city ": "Grayling", "id": "c2ff1fb0-2ab1-44f5-b958-a6f5c0704690", "state_abbrev ": "MI", "city_longitude ": "-84.7147512", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
