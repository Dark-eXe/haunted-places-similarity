He wears a charred and blackened fireman\u2019s outfit, and often wields an axe. A fire alarm sounds during the night on many occasions sending students outside into the dark night. Here they may catch a glimpse of his darkened figure in various dorms windows, while they listen to the sound of the sirens rushing to the scene to secure the false alarm. Students return to a scent that is often described as being similar to that of a smoldered burnt out campfire and fire traces of ash and soot on doorknobs and handrails, though a single flame is never found.", "state_abbrev ": "MA", "latitude ": "42.6677049", "id": "f6f348a0-55a9-48cc-a443-7f4f620ecf9a", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
