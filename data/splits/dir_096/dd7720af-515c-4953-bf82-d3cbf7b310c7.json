However, some nights they do not show themselves. They are supposedly a man and a woman. There is also a piano that only plays at exactly 12:00 midnight. The man usually shows up as an orange glow in a field beside the cemetery. The woman is usually a whitish glow. She usually shows up near a group of pine trees in a far corner of the cemetery.
