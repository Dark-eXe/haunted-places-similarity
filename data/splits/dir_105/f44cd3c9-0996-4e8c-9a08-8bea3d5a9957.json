The school was built in 1951 and was built on farmland in the area that was bought by the local school district U46. There is no documentation that would prove the existence of an activity.- January 2006 Update: Urban Legend. Another District U46 school. Built in 1951, nobody has ever been reported to have died on the property. This is another classic urban legend that students made over the years to scare incoming students. And as a side note please remember that all schools in U46 are on Private Property and unless you are an employee of the district or a student or parents of a student they do not want anyone to be near the place for the safety of the students. WARNING:If there is anyone that is planning on doing anything in any of those locations they must be sure that they have permission first else they will be arrested.", "id": "f44cd3c9-0996-4e8c-9a08-8bea3d5a9957", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
