His mother, who reportedly suffered severe depression, would sneak into a small room next to Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s room, and he would hear her crying and then giggling to herself throughout the night. She supposedly would inhale methane there. There have been many reports, especially by the people who work there,(it is a museum now)of footsteps in the small room, the feeling of being followed, cold spots, and most eerie, the sounds of sobbing and giggling.
