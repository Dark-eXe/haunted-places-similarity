{"description ": "At night in three ghostly lights can be seen two of them red, and one white. In the late 1700's a Mingo Indian chief had a white wife, and another Indian whom he loved. The Indian pushed the chief and his white wife over the cliff, but fell in with them. They were refused a Christian burial, and now, you can see the three lights struggle on the top and fall, disappearing near the Tuscarawas River.", "state_abbrev ": "OH", "id": "a2f989a2-8d81-4c1f-89ae-ccd07db16c4b", "location ": "Stone Quarry", "city ": "New Philadelphia", "country ": "United States", "state ": "Ohio", "city_longitude ": "-81.4456706", "longitude ": "-81.48194099999999", "latitude ": "40.493663", "city_latitude": "40.4897871", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
