It is said that the headlights of a truck will just appear out of no where and chase you till you run off the road in which many people have died on that road. There is also an old bridge that is still there but condemn now, that a school bus full of kids fell over side down into the river killing them in the process. Since then, the have a new road and bridge near an intersection by a white church leading away from the old creepy one, which is in the vicinity of east of the new bridge. You will see a large metal road block next to a Historical Marker which I think someone stole. In the mist of the trees you can see the metal beams of the bridge. You can still walk over the old bridge which base road is made out of wood planks; and you're quiet and listen, you will hear the cries of the screaming children. There is also a grave yard across the road from the bridge which has been rumored to have a witch's grave in it. The headstone glows a shimmering orange color like the reflection of flames from a fire when there is a full moon.", "city ": "Near Oakalla", "id": "72d51c87-4971-4f17-9f5a-42474890adb2", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
