Some say that the painting there is fine at first but then bleeds when they turn their backs, & the eyes on the painting seem to follow you around the room. the piano plays on its own & blood appears on it as well. You can hear and see chains when you look in the chimney if you hike to the cabin. Bloodstains on the wall and carpet.
