Also there have been reports of cloud formations forming skull-like shapes. Also, when no one is around you, sometimes shadowy figures can be seen walking behind you, sometimes hiding behind bushes. The crackling sounds from the power lines overhead don't help the experience too much, adding a deeper eeriness to this location.", "longitude ": "-117.7179162", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
