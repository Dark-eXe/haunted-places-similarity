The former brig, which is the only original building remaining on what is now a state park and camping area, has been the scene of several apparitions, all described in detail by at least half a dozen state employees. These employees worked in the brig building, which was for many years used as a state parks maintenance building. All of the employees who encountered a ghostly visitor talked about a balding man who might have been in some kind of uniform - possibly prisoner's garb. Others, who did not see the apparition, talked about hair-raising experiences with large objects being mysteriously \"relocated\" or objects flying across the cells - which still exist in the building, bars and all.", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "47.951532", "city_longitude ": "-116.7079745", "state ": "Idaho", "location ": "The Brig at Farragut State Park", "city ": "Athol", "id": "0541e573-5c2b-4732-896e-2990df3785cd", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
