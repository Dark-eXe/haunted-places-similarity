It has changed hands several times and many of its owners have died in the house (at least 3). A true ghost story accompanies every single room in the house, ranging from odd sounds, a haunted clock, temperature changes, to sightings of ghosts. In October, the museum hosts ghost tours where the stories are told.", "city_longitude ": "-81.45484359999999", "city ": "Marietta", "state_abbrev ": "OH", "longitude ": "-81.4549334", "id": "0688b40d-22a6-4c47-98a2-8469bd647267", "country ": "United States", "state ": "Ohio", "city_latitude": "39.41535200000001", "latitude ": "39.4205341", "location ": "The Castle", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
