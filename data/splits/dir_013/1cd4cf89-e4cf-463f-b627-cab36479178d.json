One was an angry man of about 27 or 28 who didn't know why females where there and wanted them all out of \"him air force\". This was an uncomfortable presence that would just sit three or four yards (sometimes halfway up the stairs while you were guarding the entrance) and concentrate loathing on you, also he would mess with the tuning on your radio. Also there was a boy named Jeremy who was 18. He was a sweet kid who would check on everyone in the evenings and make sure everyone was alright. He also would play pranks like opening windows at night and dropping things inside locked wall lockers when you are across the room. One soldier learned he missed his mother, he went through the school in 1967 and although he knew he had died of shrapnel wounds, he would often worry about going to 'Nam \"tomorrow\". Jeremy, for the record was very polite in that if you were studying with your door closed he would continue down the hall. He seems to need the encouragement of an open door for an invite to interrupt any study hall sessions.", "city_latitude": "30.3960318", "longitude ": "-88.9252664", "country ": "United States", "city ": "Biloxi", "latitude ": "30.4094159", "location ": "Keesler Air Force Base", "state ": "Mississippi", "city_longitude ": "-88.88530779999999", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
