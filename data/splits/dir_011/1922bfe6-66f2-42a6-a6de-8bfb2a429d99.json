Apparently a little girl about 9 years old with blond hair was hit and killed by a car in the early 70's. Today guests report seeing a little 9 year old girl come running up to them crying \"Mommy, Mommy, Please help me find my Mommy!\". The guests usually think this is a typical lost child. The guests agree to take the girl to someone to find her mommy and proceed with her. They get no more than 10 yards when they notice the little girl has completely disappeared and is nowhere in sight. Some people have actually gotten a photo of the little girl.", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "33.7705277", "state ": "Georgia", "city_latitude": "33.8126059", "longitude ": "-84.55153700000001", "location ": "Six Flags Over Georgia", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
