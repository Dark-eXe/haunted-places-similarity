She frequently rings the motion detector. One year the owner decorated the rooms with fake Christmas trees and Rebecca knocked them over every night. She once warned the owner of a gas leak in the kitchen. There are also several other ghosts including those of children. There are a lot of very curious customers at the restaurant and wait staff encourages it by turning off lights when customers go to the restroom.", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-120.2746191", "longitude ": "-120.2771816", "city ": "Dorrington", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
