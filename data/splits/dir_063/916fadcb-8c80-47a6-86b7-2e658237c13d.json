{"latitude ": "38.0220263", "description ": "Images of Confederate Soldiers have been seen on and around this very high sandstone rock formation, it has been said, this was once a lookout post during the civil war. Also, there have been several sightings of a woman who paces around on top and for a few minutes and then plunges herself over the edge. Her screams, as she falls, can be heard up to a mile away. The forest and surrounding hollows in this area have produced sounds of orders coming from soldiers on the battle field, moans, cries of agonizing pain, and sightings of both confederate and union soldiers. Carrington Greens Golf Course has had reports from several of their customers about weird noises and seeing soldiers on the course, which is located on most of the battle field.", "location ": "Carrington Rock", "city_longitude ": "-83.62574520000001", "country ": "United States", "state ": "Kentucky", "id": "916fadcb-8c80-47a6-86b7-2e658237c13d", "city ": "Frenchburg", "city_latitude": "37.950916", "state_abbrev ": "KY", "longitude ": "-83.6251899", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
