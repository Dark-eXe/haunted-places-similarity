The key is that the doors can only be activated from the inside of the morgue. The area near the cafeteria is also said be haunted. A soft, eerie moan can sometimes be heard coming from the area late at night. There are reports of the nurse's call button being pressed late at night on the third floor in unoccupied rooms. The voices of children laughing and running can often be heard in the old section of the admin offices from the basement.", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-102.7896242", "state_abbrev ": "ND", "state ": "North Dakota", "location ": "St Joseph\u2019s Hospital", "city_latitude": "46.8791756", "id": "0d31a717-db19-4459-bdd0-79ed35e5ccad", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
