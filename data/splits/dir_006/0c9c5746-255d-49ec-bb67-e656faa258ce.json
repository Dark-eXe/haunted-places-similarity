There was a single daughter who was forced to stay in the house all day, every day to clean and cook while the other men were out in the fields. She's still alive, she's 97.

A great example of a residual haunting that happens even though the person is not dead.", "location ": "Highlands Ranch Mansion", "country ": "United States", "city ": "Highlands Ranch", "longitude ": "-104.9709266", "state ": "Colorado", "city_latitude": "39.5480789", "id": "0c9c5746-255d-49ec-bb67-e656faa258ce", "latitude ": "39.5357729", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
