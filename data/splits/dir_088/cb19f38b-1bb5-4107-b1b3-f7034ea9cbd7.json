{"city ": "Brownsville", "state ": "Texas", "description ": "The old morgue building - used as a storage building and a three room accounting office. There are strange noises in the building, which cannot be identified. Reports of apparitions of a woman and small child, books fall from shelves, chairs move in the library, voices and doors opening and closing are heard, and a lady dressed in black has been seen sitting on a wall in front of the Old Morgue. Also, electrical devices in the building will suddenly stop working or break for a while. Later they will start working again. Plugs will also pull out of sockets by themselves and stored items will move themselves. These are supposed to be caused by the ghosts of soldiers whose bodies were stored here. A picture was taken in May of 2001 of what appears to be a hanged body.", "city_latitude": "25.9017472", "id": "cb19f38b-1bb5-4107-b1b3-f7034ea9cbd7", "latitude ": "25.893722", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-97.4974838", "location ": "University of Texas", "longitude ": "-97.486664", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
