One legend surrounding the house is where a nurse hid a Union soldier in the wall of the basement when the Confederates came to inspect the house. When they found Union paraphernalia in the storage room they arrested the woman and took her away. The Union soldier ,unable to help himself escape, died and today can be heard scratching at the walls for someone to be let out. This is a story told by the caretakers of the house. In 1953, when they were rebuilding the basement of the house they found a body of a Union solder behind the walls.", "state_abbrev ": "VA", "city ": "Hopewell", "state ": "Virginia", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-77.28720009999999", "latitude ": "37.3090693", "location ": "Appomatix Manor", "longitude ": "-77.3039443", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
