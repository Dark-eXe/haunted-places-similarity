Right next to the current school is a much larger but condemned school. Kids report few weird occurrences, such as looking at the school and seeing a small child run real quick in front of the window, or hearing a noise come from the building at recess. Or ever seeing a mist at the treetops of the woods directly behind the school. Kids have a few stories about the school. Here are a few, one is that a teacher was to be fire, he flipped out and killed many students and teachers with a gun. The other is that for a while it was an insane asylum, and the last is that the kids teased a girl saying her mother was a witch, so her mother put a curse on the school, and the school caught fire trapping many people inside, they say it is her ghost that causes the fog in the woods. - September 2004 update: Has since been torn down.", "city_latitude": "39.649508", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
