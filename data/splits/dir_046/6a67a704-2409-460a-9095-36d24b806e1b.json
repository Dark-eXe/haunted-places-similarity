It is painted green, vines have long since overgrown the name and front. Pictures taken on three different days and times (lighting) all show a \"mist\" in the top corner. One the shape of two figures is clearly visible. Vandals have written, \"meg lives\" on the ground in front and a pentagram in red on the door. A deep sense of unease is felt in this circle.
