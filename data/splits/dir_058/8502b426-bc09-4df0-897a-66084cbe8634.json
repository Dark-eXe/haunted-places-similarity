{"description ": "Kahala - Behind the storage building used to be a huge graveyard. A Drive in was built over half of the graveyard. One day a woman went into the bathroom and saw a reflection of an old woman in a black dress standing behind her with no feet coming out at the bottom. When the woman turned around to look behind her no one was there. She ran out terrified and was committed to the mental hospital. There are real police reports of this incident. Eventually the drive in closed down and the other half of the graveyard next to the drive-in along with the drive-in is now a neighborhood of luxury homes.", "location ": "Waialae", "city_longitude ": "-157.8583333", "state_abbrev ": "HI", "country ": "United States", "state ": "Hawaii", "city ": "Honolulu", "longitude ": "-157.7762165", "latitude ": "21.2705629", "id": "8502b426-bc09-4df0-897a-66084cbe8634", "city_latitude": "21.3069444", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
