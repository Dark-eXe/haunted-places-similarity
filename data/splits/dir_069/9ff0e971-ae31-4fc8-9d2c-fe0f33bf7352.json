The overpass was built to cross a set of train tracks. Workers dug up the cemetery and moved it to the woods beside it. Now It is a extremely evil area. Several business's along the tracks have reported violent disturbances. There was a Putt Putt course along the tracks in the area that became a church, when the church would be closed in the night demonic screams could be heard from inside. The woods are very active as well, There are images seen floating through the woods as well as red lights, which are believed to be a gateway into pure evil.", "city_longitude ": "-95.2621553", "latitude ": "", "id": "9ff0e971-ae31-4fc8-9d2c-fe0f33bf7352", "city ": "Humble", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
