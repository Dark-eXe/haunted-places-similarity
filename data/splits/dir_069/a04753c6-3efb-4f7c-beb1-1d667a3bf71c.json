He was called Smokey because he smoked like 6 packs a day. Well one day he disappeared. The foreman thought he just took off and didn't give it a second thought. Once the school opened girls started smelling smoke in the girls locker room. At first everyone thought that some one was smoking before gym class. The female gym teacher then stood guard to catch anyone smoking. She never caught anyone but the smoke smell is always there.", "location ": "Rutland High School", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-72.9546905", "city_latitude": "43.6106237", "city_longitude ": "-72.9726065", "state ": "Vermont", "latitude ": "43.6174987", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
