Explorers were told by locals that it used to be a dead baby (children's) cemetery but that something happened in which all the gravestones were removed to \"start over.\" most of the stones remaining are not of children and some date back to early 1800's. one particularly disturbing experience was finding a name that was my mother's maiden name on a stone.", "id": "91ecdf46-1b8c-47d0-b724-35a087a78f34", "country ": "United States", "state_abbrev ": "WI", "city_latitude": "43.5391486", "longitude ": "-89.5687178", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
