Several rooms still have the curtains hanging in the windows that have been seen moving even though no one is in the building. There is also a rumor that the place was broken into by Satanists. They were said to have called forth demons, which are now trapped there. There is even a story about Room 529. It is said to have an open Bible lying in the floor.
