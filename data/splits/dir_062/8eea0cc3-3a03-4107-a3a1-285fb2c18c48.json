{"latitude ": "30.670071", "city ": "Fernandina", "description ": "Fort Clinch is an old Union Civil War fort that was never finished due to of lack of funding from the government. During construction, the fort was ambushed quite a few times by Confederate troops. Several of the Union men died in the process. One incident included a man who was shot after promising his wife in a letter that he would not die until seeing her again. He is said to haunt the fort today. Re-enactors that volunteer at the fort often see his ghost in the courtyard along with several of his comrades. Perhaps he is searching for his wife?
