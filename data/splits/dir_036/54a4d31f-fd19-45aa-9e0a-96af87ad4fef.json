Pictures come off the walls, knives move across tables, and glasses break by themselves. There is supposedly a man who regularly appears in the bar area, holding a beer. A daughter of a patron described in detail five ghosts that she saw, including a young girl, about 2 years old. She even said that one ghost had his hand on her parent\u2019s shoulder, trying to get their attention.", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-76.7452029", "latitude ": "39.2259538", "city_longitude ": "-76.7625073", "location ": "Belmont Conference Center", "state_abbrev ": "MD", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
