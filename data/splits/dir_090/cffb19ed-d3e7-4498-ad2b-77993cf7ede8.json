{"description ": "Freezing cold spots. Mist. It's all woods with dirt winding roads that never end. There's a cross in the middle of nowhere. Witnesses report that there were cars behind them then they disappeared out of nowhere like they weren't even there, sick feelings & apparitions of a woman. The cross is not in the middle of nowhere. It is part of the Green Cathedral. People get married and children are christened there. It is a place of worship for the staff & campers during the summer - as well as other guests throughout the year. There is an arch on the ball field with a cross on it. If you go down the steps there are benches to sit on an altar.", "state ": "New Jersey", "longitude ": "-74.6271798", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "39.9726147", "location ": "Mount Misery", "state_abbrev ": "NJ", "city ": "Browns Mills", "latitude ": "39.9583259", "city_longitude ": "-74.58293309999999", "id": "cffb19ed-d3e7-4498-ad2b-77993cf7ede8", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
