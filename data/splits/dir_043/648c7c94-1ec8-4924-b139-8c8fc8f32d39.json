A couple sitting on a bench is a favorite target. The entity shakes the closest bush or shrub violently, and growls very low if you do not pay attention. Some people are unable to enter the amphitheater at night because of the forbidding, brooding feelings within. The Columns Amphitheater was named for the four columns from the original University of Washington building located closer to downtown.. Have no idea if the entity came from the original building or is some angry student, but he seems to be male and a young adult. Someone might consider taking a camera in there!", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
