She has been seen by some crossing the sidewalks over to the hall, and watching over people in their rooms as they sleep. Many people have also unexplainably had their doors Open in the middle of the night, despite them being locked. It is thought to be good luck if she watches over you.", "state_abbrev ": "PA", "city_longitude ": "-80.0564468", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "41.0639506", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
