There was no one in the ceiling, no place to go. Often we could hear dogs barking inside the building. A security guard quit after seeing a person running and then disappearing into a wall. A doctor was murdered by his jealous wife in that area. Also, the top floor of the facility performed abortions on young un-married women. Also the ICU was on that floor.
