When you go by the house at night you can see blue lights flickering on and off on the grounds and in the tower window. According to legend the man couldn't stand the thought of burying his lovely young wife so had a special glass coffin built and placed in the tower. He would go visit his wife every night. The tower was lit by soft blue lights, her favorite color. - June 2008 Correction / Additional information: It was located on Fall Creek Road and is now Skiles Test Park. The house was abandoned and torn down in the 1980's. It also says that the owner had placed his deceased wife into a glass coffin and displayed her in a tower. This part of the story is also incorrect. The story goes that Mr. Skiles Test, after the unexpected death of his wife, had her placed in a glass coffin and displayed in a large bay window of his home surrounded by blue lights. Now that Mr. Test has passed away and the house has been torn down, at night you can still see the glow of the blue lights. The story of the house of blue lights is not true but it is a story that I would like to pass down to my children. The reason that Mr. Tests home was called the house of blue lights is because he loved the color so much that he kept his Christmas lights up on his house and around his pool year round. Mr. Test was a very wealthy business man that was committed to his community and even donated a parcel of his land to the Lawrence Township School Board. The school board graciously accepted the land and built an elementary school on it named after Mr. Test. Soon after his death, Mr. Tests family donated his estate to the city of Indianapolis and it was turned into a nature preserve.", "id": "958c655b-870b-4613-89a1-104556c91611", "latitude ": "39.8678816", "country ": "United States", "location ": "House of Blue Lights", "state ": "Indiana", "city_longitude ": "-86.158068", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
