The story behind the church is that back in the late 60s early 70s and young boy was playing in the church at the time, an escaped convicted was hiding in the back pew, and brutally murdered the little boy. In the church can be found blood handprints all over the walls and ceiling, small enough to belong to a young child. Among walking in the church you will encounter cold spots and scratching noises on the left hand wall if entering from the side doorway.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
