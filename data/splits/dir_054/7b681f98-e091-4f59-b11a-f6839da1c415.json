{"location ": "Fairfield University", "state_abbrev ": "CT", "description ": "Dolan Hall - Former convent-turned-residence hall for Fairfield U. is said to have the ghosts of former nuns roaming the halls. There is one story (which probably isn't true, but you never know) of a nun who was raped by a priest, got pregnant and hung herself. More recently, a student died in one of the rooms and the room is no longer occupied due to uncontrollable temperature changes. Loud and unexplainable bangs awaken and frighten students between midnight and 4AM in rooms 231, 229, 227, and 225, yet no other rooms in that hallway can hear the noises at all. - November 2003 update/correction: A student that lived in the infamous Dolan 231, reports while they didn't hear any banging, they COULD hear people moving furniture above them. However, when the RA's went up there to tell them that it was 2AM and they were trying to sleep, they found that they TOO were sleeping and not moving furniture at all. The rumor about the nun is NOT true at all, but the room that the student died in IS true and WAS taken offline because of the uncontrollable heat.
