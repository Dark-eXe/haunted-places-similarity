But she got caught with marijuana and thought she was going to lose her spot as a cheerleader. So she got a gun and committed suicide. There was a sighting in about 1998 or 1999. Hayden's softball team had a tournament, and one of the teams stayed in the Jr. High gym. They said that at about 12:00AM, they saw a young girl dressed in a cheerleader uniform, doing a routine. As soon she was done, she disappeared. There is also another story of a man who lost his life on the football field. While he was running the ball, he got tackled, broke his neck, and died instantly.
