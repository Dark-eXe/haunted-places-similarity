Shades often going up without anyone near them, sounds of marbles rolling across the roof, and hissing noises that travel throughout each room. Trees outside forming the letters to spell out the name Julie, a girl who mysteriously disappeared from the 4th floor. Hand prints found on the outside part of a 3rd floor window. Keyboard letters going up and down as though someone was typing when no one was near the computer. Banging on headboards until someone yelled stop and the noise went away.", "city ": "Beverly", "state_abbrev ": "MA", "longitude ": "-70.8408093", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
