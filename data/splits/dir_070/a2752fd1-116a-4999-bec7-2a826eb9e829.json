There have been several occurrences involving loud noises from above, sort of like a helicopter, loud enough that you can't hear the person next to you talk.\u00a0 There is also a patch of thick pine trees off the trail not too far from the parking area. Inside there are 2 large stones 75% buried in the ground across from a headstone type object.\u00a0 This whole area is open and is about 10' by 10'.\u00a0 If you carry a propane lantern or flashlight into the opening it will go out and lighters will not light. You can still hear the gas from the lantern but it will not light until you leave the opening.\u00a0 You can always hear various strange noises coming from the woods as soon as the sun goes down.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
