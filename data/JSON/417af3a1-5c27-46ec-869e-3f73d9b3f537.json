There is a graveyard to the right of the church. Rumors are that is a hot spot for seeing UFOs, but other things have gone on there too--Black Mass has been held in the abandoned church; evidence has been left behind, like inverted pentagrams in red paint or blood on the floor. I've been there and there is a positively suffocating force there--it's like you can't breathe and you get the impression there are tons of eyes watching you. Very creepy! And, just down the hill from the church is Crybaby Bridge, where at midnight if you turn off your car on the bridge, you can hear the sounds of babies and small children crying.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
