It was the early morning and still somewhat dark, she was driving too fast and the road was too curvy. At any rate all they found was a bridal veil floating in the water, as she had slid off the road and presumably been killed. If you drive up the canyon to Huntsville in the early morning you might see a hitchhiker dressed in a white dress. Some people who have stopped claim that the woman says she is late for her wedding and upon reaching Huntsville limits vanishes from the car.", "longitude ": "-111.6018617", "city ": "Ogden Canyon", "country ": "United States", "id": "0a997e60-da08-4dfc-903e-43bec742fc49", "city_latitude": "41.2487395", "state_abbrev ": "UT", "location ": "Bridal Veil Falls Road", "latitude ": "40.338954", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
