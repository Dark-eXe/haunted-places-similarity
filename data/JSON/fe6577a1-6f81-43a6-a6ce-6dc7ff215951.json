The building was constructed in the early 1970's, originally as a toy store. The owner went bankrupt around 1975, and having lost everything he owned trying to keep his business afloat in this impoverished area, closed the doors for a final time. Haunted by Harry. He has been felt passing people in the stairwell. He has been seen breaking mirrors. His apparition seen crossing the stage during performances. Also, the women's dressing room seems to have strange occurrences: the sequin dresses on the clothes racks \"rattle\" on their own violation, and shadows can be seen where no one is standing.", "id": "fe6577a1-6f81-43a6-a6ce-6dc7ff215951", "city ": "Bakersfield", "latitude ": "35.3925669", "city_longitude ": "-119.0187125", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
