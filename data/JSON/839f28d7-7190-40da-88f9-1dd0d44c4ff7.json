The children's graves are have unmarked wooden markers, perhaps because the bodies were unidentifiable, or perhaps because the townsfolk did not want to remember what was done there that day, the teacher is buried next to the children and her grave is unnamed and is marked by a four foot high pile of bricks. Loud, clear, but unintelligible voices can be heard, apparitions, or as called locally, walkers can be seen, sometimes taking a human-like form, sometimes in the form of animal-like creatures, lost time can also be experienced. Bricks taken from the grave have, in my experience cause spontaneous fires of objects they are near/on.", "country ": "United States", "state ": "Georgia", "city_latitude": "31.0410373", "id": "839f28d7-7190-40da-88f9-1dd0d44c4ff7", "city_longitude ": "-83.0751471", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
