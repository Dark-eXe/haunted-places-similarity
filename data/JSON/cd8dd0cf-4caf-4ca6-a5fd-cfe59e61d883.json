It is all broken up and windows are busted due to kids. At night if you were to go and look around the house, curtains in the window move and windows open and close, and strange lights are often visible in them. If you were to go inside and walk around you can hear heavy breathing, loud footsteps, screams, and even able to see silhouettes of figures walking. Sometimes you can feel as though something walked threw you and sometimes you may encounter a sudden pain in the wrists of your hands over all the place has just a creepy feel. - October 2004 update: This building is the last remaining building of Dunes Correctional Facility. Its the old Trustee Bldg. that housed 80 inmates. This place is now being vandalized horribly and the police ARE prosecuting! The Junction itself is a myth. Allegan County Historical Society has stated repeatedly that \"The Junction\" insane asylum has never existed.", "city_latitude": "42.6550248", "country ": "United States", "state_abbrev ": "MI", "id": "cd8dd0cf-4caf-4ca6-a5fd-cfe59e61d883", "latitude ": "", "city ": "Saugatuck", "location ": "The Junction Asylum", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
