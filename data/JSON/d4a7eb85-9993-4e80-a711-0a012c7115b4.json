The ghost has been seen by many custodians who just recall seeing a student who appear and then vanish. The ghost would also scream help me which at times would very much scare the campus police who would go in the building to inspect the screams. Many students in the past have tried to spend the night in the library and have only heard the screams. -  March 2004 Correction:Although there were a couple of rapes, no one was ever murdered.
