It is all forest. It is said that back in the old days devil worshipers and members of the KKK used to worship up there and kill children as sacrifices...it is said that if you drive down the road at night you can see the children walking and there is also a bloody blanket. it is a very eerie feeling.- June 2005 Update/ Correction: The story of the KKK and satanic rituals is most likely false. Rumors are told that at some point in the past it was told that a man had been wrongly convicted of committing murder. Either as punishment or in holding before his punishment he was placed in a small shack at the end of Whiskey Hollow Road. Due to some mysterious circumstances the man died in that shack before his execution or during his incarceration there. Stricken with the grief of not only his wrongful conviction but also his untimely death his wife hung herself on a tree down Whiskey Hollow Road upon hearing the news of his death. Many claimed the tree still stands there.", "city_longitude ": "-76.33270949999999", "latitude ": "43.116274", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
