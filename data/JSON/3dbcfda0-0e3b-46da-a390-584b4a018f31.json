The rooms are very small and cramped, nor do they have any restoration done. Our bathroom was glowing pink at about 3;00 in the morning. Last time I checked bathrooms were not supposed to glow pink. Our room was on the second floor, which was the top and you could hear footsteps above us. You could also hear voices in the shower, which was this really old concrete slab thing.
