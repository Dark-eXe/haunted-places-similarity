They have\u00a0witnessed\u00a0lights turning on after they've\u00a0closed for the night. An older man in what\u00a0is used as the waitress dressing area.\u00a0\u00a0also there have been reports from various people stating they've\u00a0seen a young man in the parking lot. This gentleman was hit\u00a0by a car about 10-15 years ago.\u00a0Overall the place is eclectic\u00a0both in looks and in other fashions. It's an overall neat place to go and check out one night. The manager there is a really nice guy. And the best part of all is you can look around pretty much the entire place.", "state ": "Virginia", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-77.2497049", "id": "3fc4dca9-2e0c-4139-8746-2e913f96d74c", "latitude ": "38.671912", "city_latitude": "38.6581722", "location ": "Skini Fatz Bar/Restaurant", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
