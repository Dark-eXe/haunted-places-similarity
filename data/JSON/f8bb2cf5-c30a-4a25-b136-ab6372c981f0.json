Nobody is sure who haunts it, some say it\u2019s the ghost of a boy who died and one of the restaurants was named after him and owned by his parents. Others say its the ghost of the woman who had a antique shop there for many years and cared dearly for the building. Anyone who spends any amount of time there has seen objects moving, strange sounds, and misplaced objects. - December 2003 update/correction: the restaurant used to be a place called Bischofs hardware. they were in business for many. many yeas. A man ran it, there was Minnie Bishof who was the bookkeeper there and she babysat. Mr Bishof ran it until he died at age 90! His brothers helped too along with his sister Minnie.
