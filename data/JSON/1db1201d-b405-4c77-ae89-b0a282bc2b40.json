According to newspaper accounts the accident was horrible and even described in some detail about finding a child's body on the cow catcher of the train. Although I have never heard of anyone experiencing anything in this location, I stopped on the tracks and literally had my truck pushed across the tracks. The road that crosses the track goes uphill. I have also taken photos of the area and in the woods surrounding the track you can make out what appears to be children.", "city_latitude": "34.2179142", "country ": "United States", "location ": "Gravity HIll", "state ": "South Carolina", "state_abbrev ": "SC", "latitude ": "", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
