If you look real closely in one of the old mirrors you can see the ghost of a young girl, maybe six or seven years old. She is smiling at you and giggling. Also, in the underground portion of the store you can hear glass shattering and a woman's frustrated screams but when you go look to see what's going on, nobody's there and no glass has been shattered.", "city ": "Ontario", "state_abbrev ": "CA", "latitude ": "34.0618351", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-117.6508876", "city_latitude": "34.0633443", "longitude ": "-117.6602106", "id": "69c49556-9e25-4f45-8828-4320f4945315", "location ": "Antique Underground", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
