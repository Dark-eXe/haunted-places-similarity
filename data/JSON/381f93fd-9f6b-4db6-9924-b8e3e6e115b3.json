A girl named Betsy (a student employee) was found dead on the first basement level. As spooky as that is, though, most of the ghostly events that happen in the Library aren't related to her at all. Workers and Students report that there have been strange screams echoing up from the basement levels, transparent girls thumbing through books, disembodied glowing red eyes, book carts being moved without anyone present, and all sorts of other phenomena.", "state_abbrev ": "PA", "longitude ": "-77.8599084", "city_longitude ": "-77.8600012", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "40.7982133", "id": "381f93fd-9f6b-4db6-9924-b8e3e6e115b3", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "location ": "Pennsalvania State University", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
