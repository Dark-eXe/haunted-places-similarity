{"description ": "During renovation work in the 1980's, workers and crew saw the ghost of Percy Keene, a stage manager who died in the 1960's. They saw his face in windows sometimes and thought it was a night watchman, but the opera house didn\u2019t hire any night watchman. Also during the filming of a movie based on a haunted theatre, the director saw Percy's ghost in the balcony smiling down at him. Other ghosts are in the basement. Percy's the only one who can roam, apparently.", "id": "35ae7fca-a4f0-4c64-b58d-7a9f1526d66f", "state ": "Wisconsin", "city_longitude ": "-88.5426136", "country ": "United States", "state_abbrev ": "WI", "city ": "Oshkosh", "city_latitude": "44.0247062", "location ": "The Grand Opera House", "latitude ": "44.017506", "longitude ": "-88.5386276", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
