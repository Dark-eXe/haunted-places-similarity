When any of the priests are asked about it, they quickly become furious and tell you to mind your own business. However, the place has been closed down for apparently no reason. This dorm had offices one the first floor and had students living there a few years ago. After that it was used mainly for the nursing student offices. In 2002 there are still offices and there are now athletic coaches living in the residence area.", "latitude ": "40.9198658", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-87.1563334", "id": "6ba2423a-4495-4c50-b7bf-1547d71e656c", "city_longitude ": "-87.15085619999999", "state ": "Indiana", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
