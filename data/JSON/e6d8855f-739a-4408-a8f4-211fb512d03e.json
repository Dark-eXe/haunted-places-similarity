One house had a little girl in it. That house caught on fire one day, but the girl stayed in the house so she could retrieve her teddy bear. Some days the girls that live in Smith Hall find their locked doors opened, all their drawers opened, and a teddy bear sitting in the center of their room because the little girl is looking for hers. She has been seen roaming the halls and photos of her have been taken.", "country ": "United States", "state_abbrev ": "MO", "city ": "Springfield", "location ": "Drury University", "city_longitude ": "-93.2922989", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
