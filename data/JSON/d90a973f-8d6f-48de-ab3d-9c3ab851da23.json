The wreck killed 30 people and injured many more. If you go to the bridge on the anniversary of the wreck at about 3 a.m., you can hear the whole thing, from the crunching metal to the moans of the dying and injured, happen all over again. Sometimes, a conductor holding a gold pocket watch can be seen for only a few moments before vanishing. On the 50th anniversary, a woman reported seeing the scene replayed in front of her in the form of ghostly images.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
