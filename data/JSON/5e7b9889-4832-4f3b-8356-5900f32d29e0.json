{"state ": "California", "description ": "This cemetery is an extremely old burial site that is now owned by Riverside Parks and Recreation. The grounds are run down and not well kept, complete with fallen headstones that lie haphazardly amongst the final resting places of the dead. Residents of the area (breathing, flesh and blood residents, that is) live a mere 50 feet from the graveyard! Add to this creepy scene the irony of a \"One Way\" sign situated across from the cemetery that glows eerily without the aid of streetlights.", "city ": "Riverside", "state_abbrev ": "CA", "location ": "Riverside Cemetery", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-117.2798923", "latitude ": "33.8873964", "city_longitude ": "-117.3961564", "city_latitude": "33.9533487", "id": "5e7b9889-4832-4f3b-8356-5900f32d29e0", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
