{"longitude ": "", "state ": "Louisiana", "description ": "This is a gravel road that is far from the city. It is a very long road that runs along side a wooded area. Many people have warned never to go down that road at night. A friend and I have and we now know why. There is a ghost truck that drives down there and runs you off sometimes. He will appear behind you and speed up, nearly ramming you. Then after you go around the last corner that leads to the paved neighborhood area, he disappears. There have been sightings of shadow-beings that usually stand on the side of the road and watch you drive by. There have also been photographs of mists and ectoplasms by ghost hunters.", "id": "e8c323f2-dff2-403d-9004-0621fd0bbb1a", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-93.2173758", "location ": "Old Gravel Road", "latitude ": "", "state_abbrev ": "LA", "city_latitude": "30.2265949", "city ": "Lake Charles", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
