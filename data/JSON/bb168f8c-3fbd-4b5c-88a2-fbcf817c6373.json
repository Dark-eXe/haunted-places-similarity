{"description ": "During the Civil War, a mysterious lady in a flowing lace dress was looking out her window when confederates bombed the place. She was so frantic, she took one last look at her room on the very top floor, and jumped out the window. She hit an open window on the way down, splattering blood down the wall of what is now a college.
