Visitgrs to the site have reported hearing faint yet distinctive voices in the area. One couple reports, \"My husband and I have visited the site several times and never heard voices, until our last visit when we both hear a definite voice. This time we went out there just after sunset. We definitely heard a man's voice and all we could make out were the words: noise, of about, miller, flags, and years. It was an amazing experience, but I would never go back there alone or after dark again.\"", "location ": "Cabe Lands Cemetery", "state ": "North Carolina", "country ": "United States", "state_abbrev ": "NC", "latitude ": "36.0413728", "city_longitude ": "-78.898619", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
