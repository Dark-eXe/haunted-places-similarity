{"description ": "During renovation in 1998-99, a security guard reported to his supervisor that when he passed through a doorway back to where fitting rooms used to be, the ambient air temperature dropped about 20 degrees and there was a definite presence. The supervisor mentioned that she'd noticed this herself and not to repeat this information to anyone. Being a practicing witch, the guard returned the next night and attempted to contact the presence. Using a pendulum, he tracked the \"source\" to a sub-basement containing a water heater and meters. SOMETHING had happened there, but he was unable to a certain exactly what. Nicknaming the presence \"Charlie\", he became accustomed to being \"escorted\" on his rounds through that section of the building.", "state_abbrev ": "OH", "latitude ": "39.1440636", "city_longitude ": "-84.5120196", "city ": "Cincinnati", "longitude ": "-84.6198254", "id": "cb3ca3ac-4ab9-4d32-9ef1-b8a265945d76", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "39.1031182", "state ": "Ohio", "location ": "Old Western Wood Mall", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
