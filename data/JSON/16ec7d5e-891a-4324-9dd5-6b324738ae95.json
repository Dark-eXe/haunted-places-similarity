Her ghost has been seen walking down a narrow hallway on that same floor. Ironically enough, the fire escape is located at the end of the hall. Elizabeth seems to be a likable spirit though. She has been known to help employees by moving things around in various rooms. People have also reported seeing ghostly figures dancing in the ballroom, which is located on the first floor.
