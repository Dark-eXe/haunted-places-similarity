Several reports have been made about bonfires seen one minute and then disappear the next. Freezing cold temps inside the house even in the middle of summer. A sharp turn is located 15 feet from the rubble and at night there is a car that drives insanely fast around this turn and then will disappear into a nearby barbed wire fence out into a cornfield. No tire marks have ever been found.", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
