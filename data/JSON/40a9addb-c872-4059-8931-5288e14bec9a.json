It has been converted to a private residence, but the ghosts of children are frequently seen. Many of the former pupils are buried in an old church cemetery located about 200 yards away. 8-year-old Elizabeth has been seen by several individuals (including psychic Shirley Janey) flaunting her golden-brown curls. Several people have also seen the ghost of a teenage boy walking around the entry hall, as well as a mysterious hooded figure. The rustling sounds of a schoolmarm's heavily starched dresses are frequently heard as well.", "state_abbrev ": "GA", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "33.7123305", "state ": "Georgia", "latitude ": "", "location ": "Original Lithonia Schoolhouse", "city_longitude ": "-84.1051939", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
