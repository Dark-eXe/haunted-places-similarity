Every single day, mist and fog roam the hall and there seems to be some \"gooey-stuff\" on the ceiling. It is said to be that near 35 years ago, a teen killed herself by slitting her wrists in the hall, then, waling towards the balcony, eventually, jumping off. A wall that was built in front of it closes off the whole stairway and hallway that leads near there. Nobody can even tell now that there was even a hallway there, but people do wonder how to get to that hall.", "location ": "El Paso High School", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
