On Wednesday or Thursday nights at 11:30 if you drive down Walney and you see a hitchhiker, it is recommended that you stop. He appears up to three times to give you the chance to pick him up. If you still don't pick him up by the third time, a car will come out of nowhere and kill you.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
