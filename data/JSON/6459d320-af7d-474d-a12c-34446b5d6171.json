He shat himself and died there. Cold winds have been known to brush past people, leaving the area around you absolutely clear. Gunshots have been heard late at night and strange shapes and shadows have been seen in all parts of the levee.", "location ": "Foster City Levee", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
