Which did once have a creepy incident involving a ouija board where a wall began to crack open. Also for Potter it was in room 8 on the bottom floor that the girl hung herself -- though that is debated some believe she was murdered. - January 2006 Correction/ Update: A student that attended school with the girl has cleared a few things up on this particular haunting.
