However, if you walk down the road (even in the middle of the day) you get the ominous feeling that not only are you being watched but also followed. One person who has done a s\u00e9ance there reported that there was the shrill voice of an old woman that told him to go away and never come back, though there was no one in sight, the voice seemed to be all around him. Most people from that area wont walk down that road alone and especially not at night.", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "41.4035625", "id": "ac1e0b41-335a-4700-9203-daa71645e695", "longitude ": "-72.1122491", "city_longitude ": "-72.0995209", "city ": "New London", "state ": "Connecticut", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
