The story of this is that a man had drowned his wife in this river for insurance money back in the 30's. He went nuts and finally told the police where to find her body. But no trace of her had ever been found. The story goes that if you go to the bridge, put your front tires BARELY on the bridge, turn off your lights, lock your doors, and place your keys upon the hood of the car, walk to the other end of the bridge turn around and come back, while you're walking across the bridge you'll see a light out in the middle of the river, floating on top of the water, you run back to your car, and your doors will be unlocked, engine running, and lights on.
