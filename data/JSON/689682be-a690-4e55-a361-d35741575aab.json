Some say that the spirit of the Indian is watching over the joggers who run the trail. Others believe he is protecting the sacred land. There is also the spirit of a young man who haunts the bridge on Clause Road. It was reported that he jumped off the bridge into the shallow creek and died. Joggers have reported that while they are running in the early morning or late at night, they can hear a shallow yell or scream along with a splash. - October 2003 Update: This bridge is at the intersection of Claus Road and Scenic Drive.
