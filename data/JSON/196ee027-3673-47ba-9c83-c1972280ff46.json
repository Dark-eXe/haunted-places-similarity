She is a ghost supposedly waiting for her husband to come back from sea. On the third floor of the building there is a staircase that goes up into the wall and mysteriously ends. The staircase leads to a widow's walk on the roof where supposedly the woman jumped to her death when finding out her husband was not coming home.
