Former teachers and students at the school attest to a strange feeling in the former balcony area. There is also a rocking chair in the attic that keeps rocking with no one around and no breeze. A strange man has been seen by staff and children in the church basement. Neighbors report that a former building on the site had a light that never went out even when the electricity was cut. Teachers also report feeling uneasy in the basement bathroom and hearing a strange \u201cwooooooing\u201d sound.", "latitude ": "43.006341", "state ": "Wisconsin", "longitude ": "-87.937862", "city_longitude ": "-87.9064736", "city_latitude": "43.0389025", "country ": "United States", "state_abbrev ": "WI", "city ": "Milwaukee", "location ": "St. Adalbert Catholic Church/School", "id": "363c1116-5429-4ef9-a27e-d4dcaf1d5adc", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
