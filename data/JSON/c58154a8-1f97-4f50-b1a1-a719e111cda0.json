Several of the homeless people who tried to stay there as well as some of the party goers in later days, have reported that this place is full of strange occurrences and cold spots, drafts, etc. The feeling of being followed and watched is also present. - Update December 2006 - As of 2004 this is now luxury condominiums which are also showing signs of being haunted; strange things happened all the time.
