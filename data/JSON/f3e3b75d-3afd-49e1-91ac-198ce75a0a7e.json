Finally, after a weeks time, someone reported the body to authorities.\u00a0 However, when the police arrived, they found nothing but a few scraps of clothe and bone fragments.\u00a0 Some speculate that he had been devoured completely by \"The Feral Dogs of Lincoln Highway\".\u00a0 Others believe that he now lives beneath the earth and rises from the dead on the nights when basketball games are played, waiting to prey on unsuspecting children. There are many eerie feelings associated with this tunnel, and a few students claim to have heard voices or even feel a rough hand gripping their shoulder.\u00a0 Whatever the case, you can always smell urine there.", "city_longitude ": "-85.0144124", "longitude ": "-85.0173366", "country ": "United States", "id": "f3e3b75d-3afd-49e1-91ac-198ce75a0a7e", "city ": "New Haven", "state ": "Indiana", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
