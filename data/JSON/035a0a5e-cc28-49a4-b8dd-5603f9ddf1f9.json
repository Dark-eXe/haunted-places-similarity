Directly after the barn, on your left side there will be a \"No Passing Zone\" sign, even closer, after the sign; there is a white, stone house. I have heard from a resident nearby, that it was an old schoolhouse. I went in with some friends and there are many odd things written on the walls, such as: \"Die\", \"XIV\", and a picture of a large eye that is bleeding, with a diamond at the end of the trail of blood. - October 10, 2007 the building was torn down.", "longitude ": "-88.1934967", "state ": "Illinois", "country ": "United States", "id": "035a0a5e-cc28-49a4-b8dd-5603f9ddf1f9", "city_longitude ": "-88.12271989999999", "state_abbrev ": "IL", "city_latitude": "42.0629915", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
