The basement of Sunderland Dorm was once a slaughterhouse and many students and teachers have reported hearing cattle, smelling blood or meat, or even seeing cattle in the basement. There is also a power vortex on one of the paths that goes past the farm.", "city_latitude": "35.5978935", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
