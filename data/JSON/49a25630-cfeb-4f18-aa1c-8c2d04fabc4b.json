{"city ": "St. Petersburg", "description ": "One couple report visiting the museum to old warplanes sit. \u201cOne day, we went to see the planes and there was a B52 bomber with a man sitting inside it. He smiled at me and waved and I told my fianc\u00e9e to take a picture. We thought it was great they put on a show with men dressed the part like soldiers of the war. As we left, we told the keeper what a great idea that was. He didn't know what we were talking about; telling us no one sits in any of the planes. We ran back to look again but there was no one there. When the pictures were developed, there was only a bright light where the man was sitting, as if the sun reflected off the window.\u201d - May 2004 Additional information: this area is no longer accessible to the public. The area is completely blocked off. The buildings are no longer there either.", "longitude ": "-82.6332676", "id": "49a25630-cfeb-4f18-aa1c-8c2d04fabc4b", "latitude ": "27.7559836", "city_latitude": "27.7518284", "state ": "Florida", "city_longitude ": "-82.6267345", "country ": "United States", "location ": "Boatyard Village", "state_abbrev ": "FL", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
