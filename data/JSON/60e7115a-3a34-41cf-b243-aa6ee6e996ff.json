The nanny went to check up on the baby and she found the baby dead in her crib. The nanny was so distraught, she hung herself. The parents came home later that night and found the nanny hanging over the staircase and the ghost of their dead baby looking at her. The second floor is closed off, however there is a window you can look up into and some say that you can still see the nanny hanging there with the baby looking at her.", "city_longitude ": "-79.9958864", "city_latitude": "40.44062479999999", "state_abbrev ": "PA", "location ": "Byers Hall, CCAC North Campus", "country ": "United States", "id": "60e7115a-3a34-41cf-b243-aa6ee6e996ff", "latitude ": "40.4497346", "city ": "Pittsburgh", "longitude ": "-80.01612329999999", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
