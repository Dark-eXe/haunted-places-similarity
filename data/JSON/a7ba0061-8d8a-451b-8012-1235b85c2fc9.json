Restaurant staff is familiar with her too. There is another ghost that haunts this restaurant, one that is much friendlier than the other ghost, Zoe. There is a little West Highland White Terrier, named Poogin, who haunts the front of the porch. People will feel something brush up against their leg, or hear little footsteps.
