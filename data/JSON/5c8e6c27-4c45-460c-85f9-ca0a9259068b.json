That burned down or was moved a lot later (no evidence of the church stands now). The graveyard was in such disrepair that they put a collective marker outside of it. Then, during the 50's or 60's there was supposedly a huge black man that took children up there to murder them. Witnesses report hearing them screaming and crying and see a huge black shape, a pair of red eyes, & a little boy wearing a gray \"ante-bellum\" outfit standing behind one of the only tombstones left there (Joseph is the name on the stone). The area has become a place for people to trash and vandalize, and a place for late night drinking. Very sad really.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
