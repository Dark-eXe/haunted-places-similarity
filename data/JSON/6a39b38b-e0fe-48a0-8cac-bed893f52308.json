One guest has even seen the full figure of a young girl from the mid 1800s standing in her room. Once the guest acknowledged the spirit girl, she turned around and walked through the closed door into the hallway. The owners have not only heard all these things as well but have also been touched, bumped into and had their shirttails and pants legs tugged. Objects have been hidden, and even taken only to be put back in plain view days or weeks later. It is said that there are six spirits there. Five of them are previous family and one is that of a neighbor girl named Alice. There is nothing spooky about the bed and breakfast, to the contrary, the house is very peaceful and friendly.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
