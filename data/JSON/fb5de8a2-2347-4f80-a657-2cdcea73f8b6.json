Using a 35mm camera with 400 speed film they report taking about 4 rolls worth of pictures of the site. Out of all those pictures there was 3, maybe 4, of them had several orbs in the picture. Another picture had figure in bright white standing in the broken out window. Further examination of the photo appears that it was a female and she was wearing a dress. Hopefully they will send the pics in soon to share with us. Since the house has burned down there has not been any more orbs/women standing in any other picture.", "city_longitude ": "-85.821022", "latitude ": "", "state ": "Indiana", "id": "fb5de8a2-2347-4f80-a657-2cdcea73f8b6", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
