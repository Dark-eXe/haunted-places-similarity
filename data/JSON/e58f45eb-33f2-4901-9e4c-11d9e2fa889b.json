There is a house on Randolph Street, The Taylor House, which was owned back when Oglethorpe was a big place, by Colonel George W. Fish. He built the home himself and has often been reported being seen by occupants of the home and also, walking outside along the front walk and the sidewalk. His house was once renovated and he was said to have pitched such a fit, breaking things, scaring people into falling downstairs.. etc.., that the house was forced to be restored to its formal conditions.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
