She occasionally is seen checking on the tables at the back of the bar. She has whispered in people's ears, asking if they needed a drink. She has been seen walking into the back hall. This bar is featured in our local paper just about every Halloween. I have only been to the bar once.", "city ": "Saginaw", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
