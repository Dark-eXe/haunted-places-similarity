My sister, who is a little psychic, had an experience here. Our family was sleeping in the new portion of the hotel, and she woke up in the early hours and saw a misty \"cowboy\" like-person standing in the room with his back turned to her. He had a blank stare on his face and just stood for several minutes before leaving.
