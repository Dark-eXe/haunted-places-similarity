Three Adult bookstores all owned by one company sit next to each other where that club used to be. Employees have reported sightings of a man in a cowboy hat who has a tendency of entering occupied video booths and not being there when the clerks react, since no more than one person is allowed in a booth at a time. Also the stores experience odd noises at night and have the odd object fall off of shelves as well as shadowy shapes moving about every now and again.", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-117.979804", "id": "3cd0e63c-da03-495f-8a5f-b9532e251fcb", "city_longitude ": "-117.9379952", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
