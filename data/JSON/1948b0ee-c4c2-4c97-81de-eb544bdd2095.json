One employee even reported falling asleep on the couch in the lobby and awaking to the sounds of kids playing in front of them. He saw glimpses of them as well. There are sounds of moving furniture in unoccupied rooms, sounds of people walking down the hall but \"no one is there\", the sense that someone is standing behind you, but \"no one is there\". Guests report hearing children run down the halls laughing in the middle of the night, but there are never any live children doing that. In fact it is rare that children stay there.", "country ": "United States", "state_abbrev ": "NJ", "location ": "The Greenville Hotel/Restaurant", "city_longitude ": "-74.0543036", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
