The apparition of a six-foot-tall woman, with red hair and flashing green eyes started to appear in the upstairs windows or on the central staircase. Some even saw Mary\u2019s ghost riding through the hills in a phantom coach drawn by four horses. Her apparition was often seen in the yard, throwing something down the well. Many of them reported feeling the presence of Ocean-Born Mary. Her ghost was once seen helping family members repair a garage during a fierce storm, and several subsequent owners believe her presence protects the house from harm.
