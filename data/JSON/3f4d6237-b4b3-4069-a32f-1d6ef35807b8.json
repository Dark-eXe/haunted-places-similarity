On some night temperature drops several degrees and if you walk into the tunnel a train can be heard coming from within. -  February 2005 additional info: in its time it was the second longest tunnel in Massachusetts. Weird echo vibrations, due to the length of the tunnel pass back and forth. Pigeons nest on both ends of the tunnel.
