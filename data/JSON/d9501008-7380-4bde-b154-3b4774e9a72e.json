It is said that in the 1950s there was a girl named Peggy Sue that was so depressed that she went to the bridge and jumped to her death. Her ghost now lingers and pushes people off of the bridge. It is an old Los Alamos High School tradition to go to the bridge and brave the crossing of the bridge.
