Followed it to a grave almost unmarked only the name Jessie Blue Hyatt is there and the year 2002. Witnesses visiting took a flower and the crying stopped. Another witness visited and heard again the crying she gave a windmillish sort of angel, and the crying stopped. Everytime someone has gone they too has heard the crying ... and found the same unmarked grave ... it has been reported that there has been a smell of smoke. And hard to breath. All that visit return and are drawn to place things so that the child is not forgotten.", "latitude ": "32.998919", "country ": "United States", "location ": "Parks Cemetery", "city ": "Summerville", "state ": "South Carolina", "state_abbrev ": "SC", "city_latitude": "33.0185039", "id": "28c2aba6-8db0-4e7d-ac68-b62cc096218c", "longitude ": "-80.21502799999999", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
