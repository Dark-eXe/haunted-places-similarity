One of the two who were killed has been seen and felt in the auditorium on multiple occassions by kids in the band and chorus. It shuts down lights, turns on the spotlights, turns on the music and other audio equipment.. and it has been heard that it sometimes makes noises during nightly rehersals, etc.. It once shut the curtains half way during a senior assembly. (there is a ladder that leads to a dark tunnel near the ceiling to get to the spotlight room). The spirit has been seen in the spotlight room and everyone is now too afraid to actually go up there.", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-71.48520169999999", "city_latitude": "42.00287609999999", "city ": "Woonsocket", "state ": "Rhode Island", "location ": "Woonsocket High School Auditorium", "city_longitude ": "-71.51478390000001", "state_abbrev ": "RI", "id": "0d0d6e7a-4995-4346-a082-f75c32e3d80a", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
