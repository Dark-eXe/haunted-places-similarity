{"city_longitude ": "-79.46282479999999", "description ": "Just off of this road named Fox Crossing Road lies an old lumber road that winds through the woods. While it is no longer used, it was once used by logging trucks to cut timber down and haul it out. If you walk down this lumber road at nighttime, and look out into the woods, you can sometimes see a couple, dressed in 1920's style clothing. They are dancing, and the moon shines right on them. After about three seconds, they always disappear. The story is that they were a wealthy newly wed couple back in the 1920's, and they planned on building a mansion out in these woods, equipped with a giant ballroom for dancing. But they were both tragically killed just as construction of their mansion started. And now they say their spirits dance together forever, in where their ballroom would have once stood.", "location ": "The Fox Crossing Road Woods", "city ": "Laurinburg", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-79.511252", "state ": "North Carolina", "state_abbrev ": "NC", "city_latitude": "34.7740494", "latitude ": "34.7432249", "id": "d43087e9-8cc8-41b6-90ce-de0c156461d1", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
