It was an old courthouse, but now it\u2019s just a museum to artifacts of a variety of old things. The blinds open and shut by themselves, and knocking can be heard in the upstairs kitchen and bathroom. A door was sealed off in the bathroom and the knocking usually comes from outside the door, only outside the door is nothing but the world. A wall was built behind the door and the knocking, noises and movement have yet to be explained.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
