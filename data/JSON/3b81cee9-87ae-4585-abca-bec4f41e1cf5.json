The ghost of a woman looks out over the swimming pool, from one of the rooms, when children are playing, supposedly to watch over them.

She does little poltergeist activities mainly- (guests there often find their key cards missing, etcetera) and she also blasts the air conditioning.", "city_longitude ": "-105.084423", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "40.5852602", "latitude ": "", "state ": "Colorado", "id": "3b81cee9-87ae-4585-abca-bec4f41e1cf5", "city ": "Fort Collins", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
