In 2000, a group of college students decided to do a research paper on the building for their psychology class. the group had to return to the building 3 times because of being scared out of unexplained things. they decided to do their theme like the one on MTV so each guy had to go sit in a room by themselves for 10 min. well that night they got ran out by a scream of a women in the attic. so they waited a couple of days and went back. it got to the last guy and his mission was to go to the gym, he had only been there for 3 min and he all of a sudden starting screaming and said that a little boy appeared in front of him sitting in Indian style staring at him, he said the boy had a shaggy bole cut, which was the hair style that was in the 60's or 70's. he said when he looked at the boy he could tell that the boy was startled because he could see him, he tilted his head back and seamed also. needless to say that was by far the last trip they made to finish their project. when the boys went back to review their work, they noticed that when the 2nd guy had went to the basement for his 10 min section, they seen a shadow figure fly by, but when u pause it just right you can see that there is a figure of a man standing right behind him just staring at the guy.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
