{"state_abbrev ": "IA", "description ": "Just north of town is a small graveyard with an even smaller graveyard fenced off toward the back. It is said that when the Gypsy wagon trains would pass through town back in the 1800's, and one of their flock was sick and dying, instead of taking them further on the journey and not having Gypsy hollowed ground to bury them in they would just bury them there, while still alive. Many ghostly figures have been seen hanging around, and if you cross the small fence and walk on the hollowed ground you will be cursed. This is a favorite haunt for the local teens.", "location ": "Gypsy Grave Yard", "id": "87502d3e-2fb9-4cde-a93a-6c06191db2c1", "state ": "Iowa", "city ": "Algona", "city_latitude": "43.0699663", "city_longitude ": "-94.233019", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "43.1416365", "longitude ": "-94.2621284", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
