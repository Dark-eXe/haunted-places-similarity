This dorm was built in 1915. It was always a dormitory. Up to 1915, female students boarded with local residents and males lived at Ramsey Hall ( now under it's original name, The Entler Hotel.) The Entler was used as a Civil War hospital and is now a museum. A girl was indeed found hanged in the attic of Miller Hall in the early 1950s.", "id": "be3a5c6c-7e4d-4357-aa48-f6b70e25b083", "city_longitude ": "-77.8041609", "state ": "West Virginia", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
