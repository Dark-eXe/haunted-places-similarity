They hung thieves and cattle rustlers there, apparently some are still hanging around. In Blair Hall you\u2019ll feel people tugging on you, or they\u2019d smother you, they\u2019d press down on your chest. Staff would hear people laughing when they knew nobody is around. Elevators would work by themselves and the doors would open up. You\u2019d hear people talking, and hear cats meowing in the walls. Sometimes the workers would hear two dancers dancing across the stage. In building seven on the third floor, even when no one\u2019s around, doors would open and slam shut, and you\u2019d hear people talking. Sometimes you can get just a passing glimpse of the ghosts. More or less people would hear talking, laughing, and babies crying. Sometimes the big heavy fire doors in the cafeteria would slam shut.", "city ": "Dayton", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-84.1983316", "city_longitude ": "-84.1916069", "state ": "Ohio", "id": "f11d2417-7b07-493a-8861-918b6cb9da77", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
