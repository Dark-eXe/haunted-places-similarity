She became pregnant and hung herself in the meat locker of the kitchen(now the basement). Shoemaker is still a dorm, and many students report objects being moved, clocks flashing impossible numbers, lights and TVs turning on for no reason, and an apparition of a woman floating above beds late at night.", "longitude ": "-94.1515138", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-94.1632404", "state_abbrev ": "MN", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
