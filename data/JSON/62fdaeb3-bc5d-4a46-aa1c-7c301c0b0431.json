If you look on the right after you cross the bridge, there is a bright green spot of grass where the cemetery used to be. Also, walk down the road late at night and cross the bridge. After a few minutes, a horseman in a carriage will start coming toward you, and then run off the road where the old cemetery was. Then, when you go back in the morning there will be carriage tracks where he ran off the road.", "city ": "Opelika", "location ": "Double Hill Road", "state_abbrev ": "AL", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-85.3782795", "id": "62fdaeb3-bc5d-4a46-aa1c-7c301c0b0431", "latitude ": "32.671796", "city_latitude": "32.6454116", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
