The park is the former site of the Bugg Plantation, purchased pre-1842 by Judge John P. King and donated to the city by his son, Henry King, upon his death. Reports have been made for years involving a white figure that darts in and out of the trees surrounding the brick walled cemetery, and in and out of the cemetery itself. There are also tales of a Camellia bush that grew beside the old mansion (now burned down), it would bloom profusely in warning of the coming death of one of the King family.", "state ": "Georgia", "city_longitude ": "-82.0105148", "city ": "Augusta", "longitude ": "-82.012639", "location ": "Pendleton King Park", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
