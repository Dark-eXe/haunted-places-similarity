Other ghostly inhabitants include a little girl, and the spirit of the son-in-law of Buffalo Bill Cody, the man who built the Inn. He shot himself in one of the rooms.", "city_latitude": "44.7971939", "longitude ": "-106.9539187", "country ": "United States", "state ": "Wyoming", "location ": "The Historic Sheridan Inn", "latitude ": "44.8064768", "city_longitude ": "-106.9561791", "state_abbrev ": "WY", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
