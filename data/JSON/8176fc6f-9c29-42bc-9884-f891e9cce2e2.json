When the house was being restored in the 1960s, some workmen refused to finish the job because of strange occurrences (tools disappearing, hearing footsteps when they knew they were alone, strange feelings). On one occasion, a man was seen wearing a black suit and bow tie in the third floor window when no one was living in the house.
