Jamrich Building room 102 Control Room - Several people have seen the face of a young woman in the window of the control room, part of a large lecture room used by Northern Michigan University to show films on campus. A \"shadowlike\" face has been seen in the window of the control room during film showings on several occasions in the past two years. Also, the face has been seen twice by students cleaning up the room after a film event. The room is very small and is used for storage, but has also been a place where nursing students recorded their names on the wall before graduation. The rumor, by students, is that the face belongs to a former nursing student who remains to look after the wall.", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "46.5475825", "state_abbrev ": "MI", "latitude ": "46.55960320000001", "city_longitude ": "-87.39559539999999", "id": "8b44db00-6138-4d10-9a32-25534e47c3c6", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
