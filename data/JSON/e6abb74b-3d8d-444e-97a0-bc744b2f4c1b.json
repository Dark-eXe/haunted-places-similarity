{"description ": "On a old Mining road about a mile up the Hollow there is a gas road on the right, very easy to miss. You can go up in the hollow and sometimes hear a clicking sound. About five seconds after the clicking sound you can hear a sound like a bear or a large pack of dogs breathing very hard and the sound gets louder. It sounds like it is right on you ready to harm you, but you cannot see a thing. You can just feel that something is present. The whole time walking out you can still feel its presence. Sometimes it will break branches or knock over small tree, but never to be seen. It has happened in the daylight. The area has a history of weird happenings.", "location ": "Golf Course Hollow", "city ": "Wheelwright", "state ": "Kentucky", "country ": "United States", "id": "e6abb74b-3d8d-444e-97a0-bc744b2f4c1b", "longitude ": "-82.9767641", "latitude ": "36.9726998", "city_latitude": "37.3326024", "state_abbrev ": "KY", "city_longitude ": "-82.72099039999999", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
