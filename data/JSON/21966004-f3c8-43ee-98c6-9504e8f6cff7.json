After dark, anytime after dark, when you pass through the underpass, under the rail road tracks, if you don't look directly left or right you can see \"feetless\" figures lining the walkway on either side of the underpass. Many people refuse to walk through the underpass day or night because they feel weird doing so. It has also been reported that on winter nights an \"entity\" described as being 7 foot tall with no feet and red eyes knocks on windows to awaken the people asleep inside. Strangely enough some photographs have been captured of the figure and his footsteps left behind in the snow.", "city_latitude": "43.8768289", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
