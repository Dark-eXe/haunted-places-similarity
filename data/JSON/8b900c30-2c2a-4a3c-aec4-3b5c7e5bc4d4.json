The people set up a small settlement in the flat-forested region shortly after the civil war. It is said that the KKK burned the little town one night and killed a large number of the residents. A few buildings still stand out there, and lights have been seen among them at dusk. There are also reports of the smell of burning meat on foggy nights.", "city_longitude ": "-86.2016435", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
