Students and faculty alike have reported feeling a \"presence\", often while working late to prepare for school productions.\u00a0 If you are quite, you can hear footsteps walking across the stage leading into the workshop. The most common haunting is the mysterious dimming of lights, even when the sound booth is locked and no one is in there.\u00a0 No one knows for sure who or what haunts the theater; however, many have claimed that they do not feel threatened by the occurrences.", "state ": "West Virginia", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
