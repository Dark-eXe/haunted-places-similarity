In the kitchen, as well as the dining room, there have been reports from diners and workers of strange occurrences: voices, movement of various objects, unseen people touching them, non-specific peripheral vision sightings. Employees have seen objects fly through the air when nobody was there to throw them. 2 workers narrowly escaped injury from flying knives, one, a waiter/busser, was almost hit in the head by a large knife, and has also seen tables and chairs, etc. move by themselves. A man once died of a heart attack in the tennis court and has been seen by many people, all of which described the same man in the same area.", "id": "86b03434-59bf-4f99-bb2f-52fff35be7d9", "state ": "Kansas", "city_longitude ": "-94.6335684", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "38.9916726", "city ": "Prairie Village", "latitude ": "39.0118185", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
