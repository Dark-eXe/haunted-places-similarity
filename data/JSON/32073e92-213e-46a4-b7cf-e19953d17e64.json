In this cemetery is a gravestone shaped like a chair. This chair has been named \"The Devil's Chair\" it is said if you sit in it something bad will happen to you. My neighbor sat in it one night and two days later discovered he needed to have open heart surgery. Don't sit in this chair or you'll be sorry but if you do sit in it you're very brave, good for you!!!", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
