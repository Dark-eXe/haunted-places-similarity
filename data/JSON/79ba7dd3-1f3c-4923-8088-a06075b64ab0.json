It does infact look like it is on fire, esp from the road at night but is in fact only an illusion.", "city_latitude": "36.3955891", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-97.8783911", "city ": "Enid", "longitude ": "-98.0160093", "location ": "Imo Cemetery", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
