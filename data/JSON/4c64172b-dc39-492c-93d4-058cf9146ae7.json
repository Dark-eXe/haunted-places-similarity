Mass graves of Confederate soldiers are nearby, and the soldiers seem to not like visitors, especially ones with Northern accents. There exists in the cemetery, a family plot of a couple and their daughter who died on the day of her birth which is reportedly a highly active area; the sound of a woman weeping and physical manifestations are known at that grave site.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
