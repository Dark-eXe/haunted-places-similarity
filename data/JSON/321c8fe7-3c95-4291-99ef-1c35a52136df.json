Rooms that were clean become dirty with trash. Bloodstains can still be seen on the old wooden floors of some of the rooms. Screams and yells can be heard from the second floor basketball court coming from the above floors when nobody is on these floors. More than half of the staff of the YMCA refuses to go to these floors because of paranormal activities.", "city ": "Stark County", "state_abbrev ": "OH", "id": "321c8fe7-3c95-4291-99ef-1c35a52136df", "location ": "Massillon", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "40.7967244", "state ": "Ohio", "city_longitude ": "-81.2518833", "longitude ": "-81.52150929999999", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
