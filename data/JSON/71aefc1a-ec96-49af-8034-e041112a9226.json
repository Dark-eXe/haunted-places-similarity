Post, the founder of the town and of the mega dollar cereal company. I have spoke with police officers who, while patrolling at night enforcing the curfew law, have seen a person walking down the main street and around a corner. When the officers speed up to the person he vanishes or walks around corners and no trace of him is found. The local museum was an insane asylum in which Post reportedly killed himself and is said to be haunted too.", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.00014152723613033085}
