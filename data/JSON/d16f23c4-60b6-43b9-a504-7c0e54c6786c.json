Some girls have even felt the presence of a person in their room. Sometimes girls feel somebody playing with their hair along with the sound of somebody breathing near them. At times doors that are locked unlock on their own and will open. Other Girls have even heard moving of chairs being dragged across the dorm when dorm rooms on not being occupied. Showers have even been said to turn on and off on their own when there is nobody else in the dorm bathrooms. Most of these experiences have happened on the third and Second floor. Some say it is the spirit of a young girl that went crazy by playing the Ouija board and hung herself.", "country ": "United States", "location ": "Texas A&amp;M University", "longitude ": "-96.3304465", "city ": "Kingsville", "latitude ": "30.624139", "id": "d16f23c4-60b6-43b9-a504-7c0e54c6786c", "city_latitude": "27.5158689", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
