Y. Stephens Auditorium - The auditorium is haunted by the benevolent ghost of C. Y. Stephens. He is especially present in the basement tunnels that run between the auditorium and the coliseum and Fisher Building. Cold drafts and footsteps are among the ways he makes himself known. He can also be seen from the stage sitting in the back right corner of the third balcony whenever the house lights are on and the stage lights are low. His presence is thought of, at least by dancers in the annual Nutcracker production, to be a sign of good luck for the performance.", "id": "1ea79708-463d-4e2b-81f9-83673396f634", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
