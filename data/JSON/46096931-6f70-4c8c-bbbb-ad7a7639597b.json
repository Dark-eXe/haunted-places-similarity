It is positioned in a hay field on a rock road just past the local cemetery, and you'll have to be very careful not to be caught trespassing by the owner who lives directly across the road. Once you find your way in, after fighting the thorn bushes at the basement window entrance, you are overcome by a sense of unwelcome and constant following throughout the asylum. Adventurers have taken digital pics and digital videos claiming to have come up with some pretty strange footage. If you decide to go, be careful of the floors and please be respectful.
