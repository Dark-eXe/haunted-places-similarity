Many sightings have occurred late at night near the cafeteria, formerly the gym. This is caused by the lingering spirit of a cheerleader who died during a competition there. There is a cheerleading award named after her as well. In the D-hall corridor, the heating pipes move spontaneously, and make quite a ruckus.
