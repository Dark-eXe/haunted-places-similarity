It is also belived this is turning into an urben legend. There is no proof of any certain trauma at this this place.- All the windows and doors on ground level are cemented up, so you cannot enter the building, and there are no stairs inside. On some nights you can see a girl about 15-18yrs old sitting on the ledge of the middle top window wearing a light blue dress.
