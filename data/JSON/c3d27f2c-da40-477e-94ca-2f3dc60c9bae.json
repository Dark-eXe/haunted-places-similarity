Her family and the church members climbed to the top of the mountain (maiden's cliff) to have their church service. As the wind got stronger, her pretty pink hat blew off of her head. She chased it, not paying attention and fell off of the side of the cliff, into the rocky ocean below. She died there at the bottom hitting the rocks. Today there is a VERY large white cross marking where she fell and died. Some say that when looking below on the anniversary of her death you can see her pretty pink hat good as new floating in the water below, and if your quite enough you can hear her screams. - February 2005 Additional Information: When investigating this site, please take into account: The cliff does not overlook the ocean. As a matter of fact, the ocean is about 4 miles south of the location. The cliff does overlook (to some degree...it's actually quite a distance away) Megunticook lake. She died later that night at her home. She did not have a single brokenbone (she fell over 300 FEET!). She died of internal organ damage.", "longitude ": "-69.0933708", "state ": "Maine", "location ": "Maiden's Cliff", "state_abbrev ": "ME", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
