They took the bodies out in the woods and buried them deep so that animals wouldn\u2019t get to them and spread the virus. soon after they took the bodies out, they too would die themselves and fall where ever they landed. Now you can see what everyone calls \"the white ghost\" it will come around only when you do, also how can you forget the painful moans and screams. - January 2007 Update: Private Property.", "city_latitude": "43.114728", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-71.8736958", "id": "74ba4896-548f-4a2b-acfc-ee8d77540ecd", "state_abbrev ": "NH", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
