{"city ": "East Dublin", "description ": "Around 1982 there was a little girl named Gracie swinging on a tire swing thinking about how to get back at her brother (for some reason unknown),well she wrote her brother a letter saying \"I hate you, I'm going to kill you.\" He found the note and saw her on the tire swing and ran over there and pusher her off, she fell and broke her neck, she died instantly. Now it's believed that she haunts the exact spot that she died at. There is a house there and in that room over her haunting spot on early some mornings you can see her swinging looking out the window (she is said to have red eyes)", "state_abbrev ": "GA", "country ": "United States", "location ": "near East Laurnes High/Middle School", "state ": "Georgia", "city_longitude ": "-82.87180839999999", "city_latitude": "32.548222", "longitude ": "-82.819732", "latitude ": "32.561663", "id": "2ff919ce-1586-4650-9378-d59d00a6fa35", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
