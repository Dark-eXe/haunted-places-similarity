{"description ": "Eerie things seen in the back of the cemetary, a stream in the back of the woods seems to pull you towards it. Often eerie sounds heard at night, and a black cat with glowing green eyes seems to watch anyone who walks in. As you near the back, more creepy feelings seem to come upon you. Often a teenage girl is seen wandering seemingly aimlessly throughout the nights, watching, sometimes following people. In the back woods, gunshots are often heard, and screams following.", "location ": "Jacksonville Cemetary", "state ": "New York", "city_latitude": "43.15867859999999", "state_abbrev ": "NY", "latitude ": "43.217751", "longitude ": "-76.419899", "id": "72eb0a73-a743-4d8c-acfe-e864a221ccc5", "country ": "United States", "city ": "Baldwinsville", "city_longitude ": "-76.33270949999999", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
