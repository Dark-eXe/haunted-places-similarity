The house, retaining most of its original construction materials and situated across the street from the Matteson family cemetery, is creaky, drafty and very dark in the winter evenings. While the goings-on in question may be attributed to bad water pressure, settling beams, etc., there is a charming atmosphere, which almost demands the presence of a nineteenth-century farmer's ghost.", "latitude ": "41.64528139999999", "city ": "West Greenwich", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
