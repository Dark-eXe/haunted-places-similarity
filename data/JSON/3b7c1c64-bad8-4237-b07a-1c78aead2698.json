To this day a girl can be seen walking around late at night in a skimpy nightgown. Also, things end up missing even if the doors had been locked all day. People report seeing strange apparitions at the foot of the bed. Whenever there is a mention of the \"Fletcher Ghost\", a door slams, there is a loud bang, someone screams, or some other jolting noise. This is first and second hand experience when my best friend lived in that dorm.", "longitude ": "-103.6610115", "city_latitude": "29.6629938", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "30.3584919", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "id": "3b7c1c64-bad8-4237-b07a-1c78aead2698", "city_longitude ": "-103.3587288", "city ": "Brewster", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
