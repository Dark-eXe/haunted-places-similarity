And Captain Flint would go there with his sailors and take women through a secret passage that lead out to the docks and would take them onto his ship. They have had so many reports of ghostly activity on the second floor that they had 12 experts from the National Ghost Chasing Association come and stay in the second floor for 3 days. There was so much weird activity that all of the experts except 3 of them were left by the end of the 3 days. All of the experts were scared out of their minds.", "latitude ": "32.078075", "id": "01d2e70b-78bc-4eb8-aab7-085d01aff104", "city ": "Savannah", "longitude ": "-81.083885", "city_latitude": "32.0835407", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
