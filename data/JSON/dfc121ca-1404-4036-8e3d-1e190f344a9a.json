It is said that she was engaged to be married to a G.I. who was shipped overseas. When he died in combat, she disappeared days later. She waits for him to return to her. She will run past you at night. As soon as you approach, she vanishes into thin air. At times she will mumble at very low levels, but the only words that can be made out are \"John\", and \"Wait\".
