The road, due to it's sharp turns and constant hills, has been the site of many accidents. One such accident stands out though. Around 11:30 p.m. coming in from the front way, double yellow lines slowly disappear and around the next turn, off in the distance you can see headlights and a mangled car. As you drive closer it slowly disappears and there is a tree with red \"paint\", busted up from the car.", "id": "dec149a4-f18d-4ed3-8441-a040cc7a842d", "city ": "Baltimore", "state_abbrev ": "MD", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
