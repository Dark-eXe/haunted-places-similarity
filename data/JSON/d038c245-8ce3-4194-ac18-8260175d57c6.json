In 1903 it was rebuilt into the structure, which exists there today. The church was taken over by the city, in the 1940's or early 1950's, and renovated into a theatre. Now, almost 100 years later, you can hear people walking around in the Church/Theatre when the facility is closed. As well, a few of the employees have noted that sometimes when they are working in the sub-basement, they can hear faint singing coming from above them.", "state ": "North Carolina", "state_abbrev ": "NC", "city_latitude": "35.2270869", "longitude ": "-80.83994", "id": "d038c245-8ce3-4194-ac18-8260175d57c6", "city_longitude ": "-80.8431267", "location ": "Loonis McGlohan Theatre (Spirit Square)", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
