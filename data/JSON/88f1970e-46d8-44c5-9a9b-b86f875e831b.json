{"description ": "At night, voices of little children playing can be heard when out where the old railroad tracks used to be in the woods. Also, the old train conductor lantern moves up and down the tracks, but disappears when approached. In the early dawn, a train whistle can be heard, with no active railroads in the area. - March 2008 additional information: At There are many trains that still run in the area and anyone that knows the area, also knows the trains still run in East Butler and in Butler itself. As far as the lights, it is well known and also documented in the local newspaper the \"Butler Eagle\" about the \"phantom train\" in the area. It seems that some locals have fun and set up train lights and whistles near the cross roads and turn them on as cars and people pass by to see who will stop or look out for the train. There are no tracks anymore and it is pretty humorous for those involved.", "id": "88f1970e-46d8-44c5-9a9b-b86f875e831b", "city_latitude": "40.9115243", "state_abbrev ": "PA", "city ": "Butler County", "latitude ": "40.8414526", "country ": "United States", "location ": "Summit Township elementary school woods", "city_longitude ": "-79.8296743", "longitude ": "-79.82807609999999", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
