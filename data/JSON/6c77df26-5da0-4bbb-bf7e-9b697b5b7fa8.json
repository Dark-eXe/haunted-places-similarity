{"longitude ": "-80.5528964", "description ": "The middle school is a new building that has only been around since 2000-2001. The location was moved from an older building built in the early 1920's now used as a center for students who are disruptive or for other reasons cannot participate in a normal classroom environment to another building located on Gold Rush Dr. off of Neisler Rd. Teachers and other staff at the school have reported hearing footsteps in the halls at night when no one else is in the building. There are also reports of the sound of doors slamming shut when there is no possible explanation for this, although no doors have ever been seen shutting on their own. Also reports of strange sounds in auditorium. One faculty member working in the office late one night heard sounds coming from the hallway. She high-tailed it on out of there. No theories about the cause of the occurrences. Interestingly, though, everything started after a Catholic priest was brought in to perform an exorcism in the media center in 2001.", "id": "6c77df26-5da0-4bbb-bf7e-9b697b5b7fa8", "location ": "Concord Middle School", "city_latitude": "35.4087517", "city ": "Concord", "country ": "United States", "state ": "North Carolina", "state_abbrev ": "NC", "latitude ": "35.4210639", "city_longitude ": "-80.579511", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
