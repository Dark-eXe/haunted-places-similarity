Scary Dairy is tagged by gangsters, and it is rumored to have had murders taken place in the area. We are unsure if the Scary Dairy was a slaughterhouse or a dairy, but there are a lot of rooms in the building. Most of the walls are fallen down, and there seems to be lot of dumping in the area. Scary Dairy gives of a very bad vibe, and you can almost feel the ghostly activity. Scary Dairy is a cool place to check in the day, but when night falls it is probably the scariest place to be, considering the amount of rooms and gang activity", "state_abbrev ": "CA", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "", "city_longitude ": "-119.0376023", "city ": "Camarillo", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
