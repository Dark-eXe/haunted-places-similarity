She couldn't handle people and their objections. She took herself and the baby to the middle of the bridge and jumped. They found the woman's body, but not the body of the baby. People have said they have seen a creature on two legs with yellow eyes guarding the bridge around Midnight. If you are by the bridge at night you can sometimes hear the baby cry. On a full moon you can sometimes see and hear the ghost of the woman on the bridge looking and calling for her baby. More often than the other two you can see the creature with yellow eyes blocking the path to the old forgotten railroad bridge not wanting anyone disturbing the bridge or the area.", "id": "2be1d16a-5f0e-4831-b02b-6dadb1144b42", "country ": "United States", "city ": "Columbus", "location ": "The Haunted Railroad Bridge", "latitude ": "", "state ": "Indiana", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
