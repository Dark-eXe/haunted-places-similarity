The locals call it the \"Spook Light\". It is said that years ago a rail worker lost his balance and fell on the tracks and a coming train ran over him and cut off his head! He walks the tracks at night, usually at midnight, caring a lantern looking for his head. People who have seen the \"Spook Light\" can find no explanation for it! - October 2004 update: This is also the Appling County - Spooklight - listed above. it can be seen in both places along the tracks.", "city_longitude ": "-81.909826", "longitude ": "-81.8853924", "id": "c16624e0-6f72-47b2-9d51-0ba64886f333", "latitude ": "31.6074365", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
