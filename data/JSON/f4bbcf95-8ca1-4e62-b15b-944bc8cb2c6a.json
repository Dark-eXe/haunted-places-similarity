{"city ": "Darlington County", "city_longitude ": "-80.0087746", "description ": "this is a very old cemetery not used anymore. According to legend, the cemetery was moved from the original location. Hauntings include feelings of dread or nausea. A large stone at the front of the cemetery shows the names and date of death of the people buried there. Beware of sunken graves. It also seems about ten to fifteen degrees cooler at the entrance than normal. Go with a fairly large group, because it is very easy to get lost. Take hwy 34 out of Darlington towards Dillon, go thro Mechanicsville and pass old Georgetown road. Start down the hill and watch for a dirt road on the right. It is not marked. Make sure you have a driver with good judgment because of the severe drop on the left side on the road up. You can make it in just about any car. Apparitions have been known to show up on camera. <", "location ": "Montross", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "34.3649897", "longitude ": "-79.87103929999999", "state ": "South Carolina", "state_abbrev ": "SC", "id": "f4bbcf95-8ca1-4e62-b15b-944bc8cb2c6a", "latitude ": "34.3031765", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
