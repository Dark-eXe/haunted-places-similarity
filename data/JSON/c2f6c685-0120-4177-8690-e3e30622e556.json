He is said to have monstrously strong legs and he knocks over trees with them when he throws fits crying for his mother. There are trees fallen over all around the bridge. People go there to party and get more than what they were looking for. Car doors lock and windows roll down by themselves and the car begins to roll backwards. Once you are there, the baby doesn\u2019t want you to leave, thinking you\u2019re its long lost mother and it doesn\u2019t want to lose you again.", "latitude ": "", "id": "c2f6c685-0120-4177-8690-e3e30622e556", "city_longitude ": "-75.6046494", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
