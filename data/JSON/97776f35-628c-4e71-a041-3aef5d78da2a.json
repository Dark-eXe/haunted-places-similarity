{"description ": "Believed to be haunted by Sigfried who was a prisoner of war in a war camp that was on that spot. He was put to work in the kitchen and killed himself by putting himself in the oven. There is also a tree just outside of the building that was used to hang Indians and you can feel them when you touch it. In the attic, which was used as a makeup room, people have seen a telescope floating as if someone is looking for ships. There are also other parts of the park that are haunted.", "latitude ": "41.597076", "state ": "New York", "state_abbrev ": "NY", "city ": "Wappinger Falls", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-73.9364557", "city_latitude": "41.5964825", "location ": "Bowdoin Park/ old Haunted Mansion site", "city_longitude ": "-73.91096999999999", "id": "97776f35-628c-4e71-a041-3aef5d78da2a", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
