The bridge burnt down in 1974 but you can still go to the sight today. People report strange noises, lights, and the weather is never the same in the area as it is elsewhere. If you call out to Theorosa and tell her you have her baby she will come up from the water and attack you.", "city_longitude ": "-97.3733759", "city_latitude": "37.8347342", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
