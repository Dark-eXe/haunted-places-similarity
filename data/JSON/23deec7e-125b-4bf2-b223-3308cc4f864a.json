Many laughing and talking ravens are found in the cemetery during the day and if you take pictures there at any time you will have several orbs or shadow people in the photos. Also, there are several headstones that are always warm to touch--so much so that in the winter the snow often melts off these stones but not the surrounding stones", "city ": "Ogden", "latitude ": "41.2014491", "state_abbrev ": "UT", "city_longitude ": "-111.9738304", "city_latitude": "41.223", "longitude ": "-111.9619371", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
