The janitor that works there told my teacher (who told me) that at night doors open and shut, lockers open and shut, and he hears footsteps and laughter. I myself have had experiences when I was sitting in class, not paying attention, and the door was swinging back and forth when no one was in front of it or behind it. My teacher heard footsteps and an old janitor haunts the school too.", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "41.1196499", "state ": "Ohio", "id": "99d276b7-73e9-4bcf-aaa3-c0afe6f53091", "city ": "Akron", "city_longitude ": "-81.51900529999999", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
