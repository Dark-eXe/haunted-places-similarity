You can only see this glowing nun during a full moon. When you see it, it is glowing and transparent. There is no logic of the source of light or why it glows like a hologram. After you drive past the tombstone - it disappears. Hundreds of cars would line up to see the glowing nun every full moon in the 1980's.", "longitude ": "-85.71027869999999", "city_longitude ": "-85.6680863", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "42.9965143", "id": "6ff631a4-13a7-4c37-9077-5faa1f8b15ba", "state_abbrev ": "MI", "city ": "Grand Rapids", "location ": "West Catholic High School", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
