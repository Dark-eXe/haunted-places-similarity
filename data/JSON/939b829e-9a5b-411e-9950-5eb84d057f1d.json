{"description ": "Beebe Princess Hall - Second Floor - Someone or something was heard running down the hall and screaming. No one else heard this, except for one person. Another person was nudged in their bed, and scratching was heard on the desk next to her.. Her roommate heard none of this. One resident reported someone trying to open their door forcefully. When she got up, no one was even spotted near the scene. Right after she got back from checking her door, the air conditioner that had never made funny noises suddenly began making creepy knocking noises.", "state_abbrev ": "AR", "city_longitude ": "-91.8795856", "longitude ": "-91.894499", "location ": "Arkansas State University", "country ": "United States", "city ": "Beebe", "city_latitude": "35.0706423", "state ": "Arkansas", "latitude ": "35.070213", "id": "939b829e-9a5b-411e-9950-5eb84d057f1d", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
