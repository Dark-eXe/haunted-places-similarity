The Green Lady reportedly had green scaly skin like a fish and seaweed-like hair and a really messed up face, sharp looking teeth, blood and other stuff. Several years ago a report in a local paper stating that kids \"NOW\" have been seeing it right by the playground. All it does is scare the kids it even came out of the woods!
