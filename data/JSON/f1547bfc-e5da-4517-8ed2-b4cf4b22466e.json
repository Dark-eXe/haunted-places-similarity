The garden behind the church has had much activity including indistinct wispy fog shapes at night. A giant white owl that appears and then disappears. Voices that call people by name. An old Indian man that appears off in the distance weeding or tending the plants who vanishes when approached. Behind the church, up in the hills, is rumored to be a small cemetery that might be the source for some hauntings.", "jaccard_score": 0.00014152723613033085}
