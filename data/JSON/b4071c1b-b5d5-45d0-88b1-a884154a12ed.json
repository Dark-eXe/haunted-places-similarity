However many people only know of one. The second is usually impossible to get to due to terrible road conditions and the weather. It is said that if you drive to the road of the second cemetery and leave your lights on with your keys on the roof of your vehicle that when you get back your vehicle will be started with the keys in the ignition, and the doors locked. No one know exactly why this happens. The other cemetery is haunted by the grounds keeper that used to tend to the cemetery. He still tends to the cemetery at night like he used to, to keep kids from destroying things in the cemetery. many people have seen him raking leaves. Others have taken pictures near or around a certain tombstone in the center of the cemetery however when the pictures develop the tombstone is not in the picture.", "latitude ": "33.3076849", "id": "b4071c1b-b5d5-45d0-88b1-a884154a12ed", "city ": "Olney", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
