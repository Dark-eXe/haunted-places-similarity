There is a very uneasy feeling that makes you have goose bumps. The extra storage area in the basement also has cold spots. On the ground floor there have been many sightings of people just standing in the lobby where there was no viewing scheduled. At night several times a month, the motion detectors and security alarms go off for no apparent reason. They say that the main spirit is Mr. Howe the original owner but several spirits are also said to haunt the basement. - June 2008 update: the property has been sold to a developer. There are condos or some type of residences being built there.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
