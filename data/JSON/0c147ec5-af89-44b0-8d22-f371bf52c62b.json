He was a bootlegger. Most likely why he was killed. Around 1987 a former employee worked there while it was called Bradford's. She saw some weird stuff happening. One night she was closing up and heard somebody call her name from the kitchen. She looked up and saw no one. Her friend who was working there heard it to and asked, \u201dwhat was that?\u201d they were the only 2 working. The cook had left earlier. The lights flicker for no reason. They had doors separating the kitchen from the dining room. They looked like thcse swinging doors from old western movies. those would swing open all of a sudden.", "id": "0c147ec5-af89-44b0-8d22-f371bf52c62b", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-82.42491419999999", "state_abbrev ": "MI", "latitude ": "", "city_latitude": "42.9708634", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
