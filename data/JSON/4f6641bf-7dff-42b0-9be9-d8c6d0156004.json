Late at night or during a bad storm when lights go out you can see a ghostly figure of a soldier walking up and down the hallways.\u00a0 If you stare at the soldier long enough he will turn and look at you and disappear.\u00a0 There are many places in the school that is now blocked off and the school will not say why. There are still tunnels that are under the school that lead to many other places in town, but they have been closed off. Nobody will explain the mysterious things that happen in the school.", "city ": "Drumright", "id": "4f6641bf-7dff-42b0-9be9-d8c6d0156004", "city_latitude": "35.9884013", "longitude ": "-96.6124462", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
