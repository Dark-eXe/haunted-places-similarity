Numerous transients & casualties of sickness who were buried here were moved across the street and planted below unmarked wooden crosses. It's said that the restless spirits of those buried here still haunt the school, and many janitors who have worked the night shift there refuse to recount the things they've experienced while inside. Unmarked graves are said to still lie beneath the potter's field, overlooking the school.", "longitude ": "-82.6263124", "id": "99e6c629-b6f4-4ac5-a145-470a33c764c0", "latitude ": "35.6193959", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
