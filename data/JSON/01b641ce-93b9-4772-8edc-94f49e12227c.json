You can hear the baby crying and the mother singing to the baby. One will hear walking up and down the steps and a strong smell of perfume will pass by here and there. Things fall out of cabinets. Shower curtains have been jerked open. Clothes have been picked up and folded (not such a bad thing). The owner was also pulled to the top of the steps by a force before the ladder he was on collapsed. Driving by you may see the woman standing in the window. It was found out that a maid and her son was killed in the upstairs maids quarters back after the civil war.", "city ": "Hawkinsville", "state_abbrev ": "GA", "country ": "United States", "city_longitude ": "-83.4721177", "state ": "Georgia", "latitude ": "", "location ": "Sinyard Home", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
