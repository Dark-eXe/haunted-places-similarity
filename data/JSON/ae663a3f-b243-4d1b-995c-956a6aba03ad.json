Many visitors and guides have reported smelling Roses (fresh cut) at intervals followed by an EXTREMELY COLD spot. Roses were Mrs. Dorr\u2019s favorite flower. Visitors have reported hearing soft crying coming from the sick room/sewing room. A word of warning to all who visit, MIND YOUR MANNERS... Mrs. Dorr doesn't allow rudeness and has been known to 'make sure' the perpetrator doesn't stay or wants to leave posthaste. This ex-Docent has seen first hand that Mrs. Dorr is still the 'LADY' of the house.", "state ": "Florida", "longitude ": "-87.21039259999999", "city ": "Pensacola", "country ": "United States", "id": "ae663a3f-b243-4d1b-995c-956a6aba03ad", "city_longitude ": "-87.2169149", "state_abbrev ": "FL", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
