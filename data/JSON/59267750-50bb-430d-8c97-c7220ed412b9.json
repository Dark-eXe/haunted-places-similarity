You have to go away from the Chapel to encounter her. Warning, do not curse in front of the Chapel. There is a spirit who will wash your mouth out with soap if you do. Several people have documented the taste of soap in their mouths and others can smell the soap (Similar to Ivory Bar Soap in my opinion) on the breaths of the victims.", "city_latitude": "42.933692", "location ": "Woodlawn Cemetery", "latitude ": "42.94222610000001", "city ": "Keene", "state_abbrev ": "NH", "id": "59267750-50bb-430d-8c97-c7220ed412b9", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
