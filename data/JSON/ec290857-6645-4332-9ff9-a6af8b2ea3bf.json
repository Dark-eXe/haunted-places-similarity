These structures stood dark and vacant for many years, collecting numerous rumors of spooky apparitions and ghostly dwellings. Teenagers were known to scare themselves by entering late at night through a portion of open fencing, and investigate the scene by flashlight. Many heard whimpering sounds and crying down the long dark corridors, and most were too afraid to venture deep into the basement, where stories of torture and murder ran rampant.
