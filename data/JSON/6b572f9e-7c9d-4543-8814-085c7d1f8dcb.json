Also, the piano that is in the lobby plays by itself. There have been sightings of a person or apparition looking out of the window of Room 23. The rooms 305, 103, and 23 are all roamed by ghosts. On the second floor a child who died runs around after 1:00am at night. Also the ghost in 305 will walk through all the third floor doors and the lobby. The 103 ghosts just knocks little things down and looks in the window at you or whoever is staying there.
