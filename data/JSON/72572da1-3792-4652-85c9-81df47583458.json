The Ghost that haunts it is known as Jordan Basile, a young chef there who died when the oven blew up. He was around the age of 15. Now when they hold dances, food mysteriously disappears and people often trip and fall when nothing was in their path. Jordan Basile is seen at the new oven on August 16th (the date of his death) every 2 years making what appears to be lobster, which was his specialty.", "city_latitude": "42.16172419999999", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
