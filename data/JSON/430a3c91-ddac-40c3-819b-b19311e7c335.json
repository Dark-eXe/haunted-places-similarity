{"description ": "The woman known as The Waving Girl, Florence Martus, was immortalized in a statue on the Savannah River for her habit of waving a cloth or towel from the land as a helpful signal to boats coming in. The statue depicts her waving with a large dog sitting next to her. Many times the stone cloth has been seen waving as if in the wind. Many believe it to be haunted by a ghost boy who broke little children and animals necks. It is said he was hung near the river. On calm, autumn, under a full moon you can see him walking looking for victims.", "location ": "Savannah River", "latitude ": "32.085862", "city_longitude ": "-81.09983419999999", "id": "430a3c91-ddac-40c3-819b-b19311e7c335", "state_abbrev ": "GA", "longitude ": "-81.09989999999999", "country ": "United States", "state ": "Georgia", "city ": "Savannah", "city_latitude": "32.0835407", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
