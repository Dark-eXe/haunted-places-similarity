It is a small cemetery, but there is a narrow dirt road that runs through. At the very back center of the cemetery there is a huge black marble stone called the \"witch's ball\". If you get close enough you can see faces and shadows in the stone, just like a crystal ball. Voices have been heard and apparitions have been seen there too.", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "42.8795638", "state_abbrev ": "MI", "city ": "Memphis", "city_longitude ": "-82.7688134", "city_latitude": "42.8964179", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
