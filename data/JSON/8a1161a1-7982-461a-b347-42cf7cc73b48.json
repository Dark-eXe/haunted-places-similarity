{"description ": "Old Botany - Closely related to Schwab Auditorium's stories, Old Botany may be haunted by the president's wife. She is occasionally seen, sitting near a window on the second floor, rocking and knitting. Also, Old Botany is one of the oldest remaining buildings on campus, and there have been many stories of noises and sightings here. It's not really used these days, except for some offices. It's mostly a historical site.", "location ": "Pennsylvania State University", "city ": "State College", "city_latitude": "40.7933949", "state_abbrev ": "PA", "longitude ": "-77.8599084", "id": "8a1161a1-7982-461a-b347-42cf7cc73b48", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "40.7982133", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "city_longitude ": "-77.8600012", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
