Haunted by three family members. A woman, probably the original owner's wife dressed in a blue dress, a dark haired attractive man, and a slender tall man with a short hair cut wearing a long john shirt and slacks. Seen frequently in rooms not being used for a period of time and then used again. Ghosts here don't seem to want to be noticed much. These ghosts interact with the surroundings and are quite visible.", "location ": "The Baumgartner house", "state_abbrev ": "TN", "city_latitude": "35.0123024", "country ": "United States", "id": "b2a84203-3a0b-48c7-925d-627ec89cf19f", "latitude ": "35.0121139", "city_longitude ": "-85.70441489999999", "city ": "South Pittsburgh", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
