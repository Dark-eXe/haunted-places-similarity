There are numerous reports of soldiers scurrying across the road late at night. However, in 1999 or 2000, there was an incident in early October in which several drivers called police when a filthy, bleeding young man wearing a Confederate uniform and carrying a rifle staggered across the busy intersection of Lee Drive and Highland Road around 5:00pm. Police serached the area and found no one.", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
