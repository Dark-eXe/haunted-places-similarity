Many girls lost their lives in this fire. 5 of the girls died of smoke inhalation and 2 by falling out the window of the fourth floor while trying to escape. The fire started near room 405. To this day things are found missing only to turn up in strange places. A number of strange occurrences happen too such as doors opening and closing, faucets turning on by themselves, cold spots, radios that turn on mysteriously, and strange forms have even turned up in photographs.", "location ": "Providence College", "id": "063c6a82-b749-4533-9a1d-10802ad27da3", "city ": "Providence", "state_abbrev ": "RI", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
