The story is that it served as an execution site for the Waxaw and Catawba Indians. Evil Spirits were said to have frequented the site to collect the condemned souls of the executed. The consistent feature of this site is an overwhelming feeling of dread, despair and nausea to anyone who stands in the circle and takes a minute to clear their mind.", "city ": "Lancaster County", "longitude ": "-80.74138680000002", "latitude ": "34.6921515", "location ": "Hwy521", "city_latitude": "34.7253411", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
