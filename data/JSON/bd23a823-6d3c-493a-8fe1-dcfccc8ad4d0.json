When you shine your flashlight on them the light does not go through them. But yet they are still transparent. There have been unusual screaming and banging from inside the old theater. Many eyewitnesses have seen reenactments of an 11 yr old boy being thrown off the roof by a shadow like figure. There have been accounts of over 300 spirits inhabiting this theater. Some of the stories about this place date back into the 1800s.", "longitude ": "-119.288645", "latitude ": "36.329741", "city ": "Visalia", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
