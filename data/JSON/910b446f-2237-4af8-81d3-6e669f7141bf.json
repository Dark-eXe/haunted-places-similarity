Male voices have been heard at night and it sounds as if they are arguing although it's all gibberish (most of the dead were of eastern European origin, could they be bickering in Hungarian or some other Slavic language that witnesses are not familiar with?). Photographs taken at the sight often have smoky images swirling about when developed. One witness unaware that this sight was even haunted, had a an invisible entity breath the words \"Oh God!\" directly into his ear very loudly, while he was collecting firewood for a riverside campfire. This site is located right alongside of the Youghigheny Bike Trail a few hundred yards south of the mining village of Van Meter.", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "", "city ": "Smithton (Van Meter)", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "city_latitude": "40.1423108", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
