One of the old hangars at the Airport itself is also haunted, presumably by a man who was killed while starting his plane... though it's a condemned hangar used for long term storage only. Both of these, interestingly enough, are on the way to the Ghost Tracks of Shane and Villamin roads..", "location ": "Stinson Field Cemetery and the Stinson Field ghost", "city ": "San Antonio", "latitude ": "29.33893789999999", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
