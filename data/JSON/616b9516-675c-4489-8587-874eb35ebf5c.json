Goatman's Bridge", "description ": "Supposedly a lot of satanic rituals went on around and on the bridge. They were supposed to have conjured a half man half goat or a goatman. It is said that if your park your car on the bridge, turn off everything and honk your horn three times then goatman will appear. There are many different legends and the place is really far into the country. Its just off of Old Alton near Teasley Lane. - April 2008 Update: the Old Alton Bridge is closed and they have opened a new Old Alton Bridge. You can drive on the new one, but the old one is gated off. You can still park your car in the quasi-parking lot right in front of the old Old Alton Bridge and walk on it. There's a trail that goes on for hours that winds through the surrounding woods.", "latitude ": "33.1293197", "city_longitude ": "-97.0966777", "city_latitude": "33.0959546", "city ": "Copper Canyon", "state_abbrev ": "TX", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
