Evidently at some performance or rehearsal...she was downstairs from a friend of hers and decided to call up to this friend using the Dumbwaiter shaft that had been out of commission for some time. As she leaned her head in, the dumbwaiter came crashing down and beheaded her! Since the incident, there have been a few sightings. A mysterious blue lighting accompanies her spirit, and she has never been seen by a crowd...generally she is seen by actors or stage hands working alone. She seems a bit of a prankster, dropping lights, or gels or ladders.  December 2003 Addition or update: Some say it was a cleaning lady who died in the dumbwaiter and she was cleaning it out and people see her on the stage singing", "country ": "United States", "state_abbrev ": "MI", "latitude ": "43.5819086", "city ": "Mount Pleasant", "id": "da12acc0-687e-4037-a054-942983a185d0", "city_latitude": "43.59780749999999", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
