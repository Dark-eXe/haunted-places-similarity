The forest is extremely deep and is haunted at night by shadows and taking young teens away at night to get them lost in the forest. Many kids have been lost in the forest and have never been seen again. Shadows walk the forest and supposedly small nematodes (Indian like figures) grab and scratch you to the bone.
