Now a Bed and Breakfast w/Bar & Restaurant (great food!) - you should try staying the night and see if you witness anything! Before it became the bed & breakfast it is now, it was a place for actors from a former nearby haunted hay ride -property for that has since sold and is being semi-developed. The true original history of the building is not really known. Given it's age & remote location, you can only imagine what could have gone on in a bar/inn like that in it's heyday. Faucets turn themselves off and on. Shadows and apparitions have been seen. Strange knockings have been heard. And doorknobs shake for no apparent reason.", "country ": "United States", "longitude ": "-75.1501347", "city_latitude": "40.5656117", "id": "7461db16-e092-43f3-b737-9cb7671108aa", "latitude ": "40.5694524", "location ": "The Indian Rock Inn", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
