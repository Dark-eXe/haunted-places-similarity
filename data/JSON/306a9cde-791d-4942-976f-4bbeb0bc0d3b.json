In the smaller side of the cemetery there are 3 large headstones (possible the largest in that section). It was a husband, a wife and child, and a family friend. They were all murdered together in the family's house in the 1840's. If you read the epitaph on the headstones it mentions something about the wrath of God coming down upon those who did the murders. (the words are very warn and hard to read). This event was known as the Changewater Murders. Apparently the wrong people were caught and hung for the crime and by the time authorities figured out who really committed the murders, they were long gone. Orbs have been seen and caught on film.", "id": "306a9cde-791d-4942-976f-4bbeb0bc0d3b", "state_abbrev ": "NJ", "latitude ": "40.7354596", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
