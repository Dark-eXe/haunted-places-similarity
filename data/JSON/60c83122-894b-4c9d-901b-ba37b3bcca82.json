The organ would randomly play for two years following his death until it was dismantled and scrapped. He causes a lot of electrical and technical problems if a specific prop is moved from the prop room, and also he's been seen as recently as 10/20/01... He doesn't seem to be lost, an authentic haunting, as he will react to words and waving. He's a wonderful spirit, but likes to cause trouble.", "id": "60c83122-894b-4c9d-901b-ba37b3bcca82", "city_longitude ": "-96.7983877", "longitude ": "-96.783968", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "44.3189457", "city ": "Brookings", "state ": "South Dakota", "state_abbrev ": "SD", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
