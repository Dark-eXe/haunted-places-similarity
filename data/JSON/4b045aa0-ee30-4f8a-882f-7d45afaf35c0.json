{"city ": "Apple Valley", "state ": "Minnesota", "location ": "Andy's Market Hill", "description ": "Back Hill - In 1998, a ten-year-old boy was sliding down the back hill when an arrow shot him in the eye. He is usually seen at night by night sleders walking around on the top of the back hill, and sometimes pushing sleders into trees. Yet even some, very few, but some, are driven away from trees if they are naturally heading for it. It is suspected that only children are able to see him. Adults are only capable of hearing these things.", "country ": "United States", "latitude ": "44.7458081", "longitude ": "-93.20813", "city_longitude ": "-93.21772", "state_abbrev ": "MN", "city_latitude": "44.7319094", "id": "4b045aa0-ee30-4f8a-882f-7d45afaf35c0", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
