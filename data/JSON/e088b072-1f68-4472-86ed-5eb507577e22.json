People claim to have seen the ghostly form of a young girl wandering through the woods on the east side of this bridge. There have never been any known incidents where anybody has died on or near this bridge. What her purpose for being there is unknown. She seems lost as she wanders back and forth. She is seen often but she never makes a sound. Most sightings come just before sunrise.", "jaccard_score": 0.0001572524845892565}
