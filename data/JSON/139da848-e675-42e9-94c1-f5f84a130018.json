{"city ": "Mansfield", "description ": "It is haunted by Mary Jane. Everyone calls her \"Bloody Mary\". She was burnt at the stake in the 1800's because she was claimed a witch. The tree she was buried under still stands with her name carved in it. If you go there on the night she was buried then the tree will bleed. If you go back where her house once stood you will notice a sudden drop in temperature about 20 Degrees). I highly advise you not to say her name in the mirror five times if you ever visit the town of Mansfield. -", "state_abbrev ": "OH", "longitude ": "-82.4709603", "city_longitude ": "-82.5154471", "country ": "United States", "state ": "Ohio", "latitude ": "40.7519163", "location ": "Lucas Cemetery", "id": "139da848-e675-42e9-94c1-f5f84a130018", "city_latitude": "40.75839", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
