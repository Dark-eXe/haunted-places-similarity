{"description ": "February 2004 correction: Formerly posted as \"Barren Rd. Cemetery\" - There is supposed to be a witch buried in the Grave yard, there is a house built around her grave and there are times that you can go and the house will be locked. And there are times you will go and the house will not be locked...As you turn on the road it gets very cold even in the Summer time- February 2004 correction \u2013 additional information: Her name was Anna Foster and she died at the age of 28. In the last year or so her headstone has been stolen and the shelter over her grave has been vandalized and almost torn apart. It's sad and the submitter has nearly cry every time they see it. They are looking into fixing the shelter themselves. But they cannot afford to replace her headstone, unfortunately. Upon research they have discovered that she is not the witch everyone thinks. The \"real\" witch's grave is located just inside the woods next to this cemetery. -  Again, we have to state that if you are going to investigate these places, have respect for the people involved with these places. To destroy history, and vandalize graves proves nothing but your foolishness.", "city ": "Whitley City", "location ": "Barren Fork", "longitude ": "-84.4652827", "latitude ": "36.7740727", "id": "e5eaef78-c408-41d1-b0e6-4b93d45ad209", "state ": "Kentucky", "country ": "United States", "city_latitude": "36.7234118", "city_longitude ": "-84.47049419999999", "state_abbrev ": "KY", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
