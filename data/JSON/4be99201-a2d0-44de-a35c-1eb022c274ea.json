He is seen often as a shadowy figure in period clothing in the cemetery, the adjacent woods and the fields across the street. The apparition is known as Benjamin Miles, a local settler who is buried there in an unmarked grave. It is said that this is a particularly angry and dangerous spirit. His presence is accompanied by a chill in the air and the call of an owl. The sound of that owl is said to be a warning that Benjamin Miles is nearby. All of these phenomena are almost always seen at night usually in the fall and winter seasons", "state ": "Florida", "longitude ": "-81.22468870000002", "country ": "United States", "id": "4be99201-a2d0-44de-a35c-1eb022c274ea", "city_longitude ": "-81.3792365", "state_abbrev ": "FL", "city_latitude": "28.5383355", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
