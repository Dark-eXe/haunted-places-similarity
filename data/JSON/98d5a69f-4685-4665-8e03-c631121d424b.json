Strange thing is, the doors at the ends of the hallway are bolted shut allowing no one inside. - November 2005 Update: A ghost hunter recently visited Keystone College. A student took initiative to show taped video footage of the basement of Ward Hall. In the video, a light at the end of the hall turned on mysteriously and a black blob-like entity wandered across the end of the hall. The recording equipment was left overnight. No one was there to witness the event live.", "state_abbrev ": "PA", "country ": "United States", "id": "98d5a69f-4685-4665-8e03-c631121d424b", "longitude ": "-75.7774203", "latitude ": "41.5590236", "state ": "Pennsylvania", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
