People working in the basement hear heavy footsteps walking up and down the hallways, toilets flush for no reason and there has been unexplained pounding coming from inside the basement walls. Each night employees yell up the stairs to make sure no one is in the building and twice their yell of \" Any one up there??\" has been answered by the ghost.
