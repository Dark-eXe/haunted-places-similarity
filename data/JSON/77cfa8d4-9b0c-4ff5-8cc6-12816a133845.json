They have gotten out of the High School prom and went to a make out spot although they were told not to go there since the Phantom hadn't been caught. The girl was indeed tied to a tree and stabbed, but in a rather unique way: the Phantom tied his knife to the slider of her trombone and pretended to play it while simultaneously stabbing her.
