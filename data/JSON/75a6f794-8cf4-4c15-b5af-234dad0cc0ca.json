The house is said to have been owned by a farmer who murdered his wife. After the structure fell into a state of disrepair, the county decided to condemn the old shack. Since that time, many have reported hearing eerie noises coming from the area that the house is located in. Also, a ghostly figure has been spotted roaming around the cemetery late at night.
