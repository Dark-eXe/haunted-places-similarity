When the new hospital was built, the old one was turned into a small school for only the lower grades. The story goes that a deranged man came into the school with a gun where he took the students and teachers hostage. In the back, there is 2 sheds, one big and one small. It is said that he took his hostages here and killed many of them and then turned the gun on himself. The old school is now closed and many have been inside since. Inside, people have said they see figures of children and hear the cries.", "city_latitude": "33.9424658", "latitude ": "33.9657699", "jaccard_score": 0.00017297773304818215}
